Wondering how we could get students like you engaged, we realized the curriculum I had developed for the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health \u2013 the I-Corps program, now taught in 100+ universities to thousands of scientists \u2013 would provide a framework to do so.\n\nWe had five goals for the Hacking for Defense class:\n\n1. The first was to teach you to develop the mindset, reflexes, agility, and resilience an entrepreneur working with the government needs in order to make decisions at speed and with urgency in a chaotic and uncertain world.\n2. Second, we wanted to teach you entrepreneurship while you engage in national public service. Before we created H4D, if college students wanted to give back to their country, they thought of [Teach for America](#), the [Peace Corps](#), [AmeriCorps](#), or perhaps the [US Digital Service](#) or the [GSA\u2019s 18F](#). Few considered opportunities to make the world safer with the Department of Defense (DOD), Intelligence Community (IC), or other government agencies.\n3. Third was to teach our sponsors (the innovators inside the DOD and IC) that there was a methodology that could help them understand and better respond to rapidly evolving asymmetric threats. If we could get teams to *rapidly* discover the real problems in the field using Lean Methods \u2013 such as Customer Discovery, problem curation, and the Mission Model Canvas \u2013 and *only then* articulate the requirements to solve them, defense acquisition programs could operate at *speed and urgency* and deliver *timely and needed* solutions.\n4. Fourth, we wanted to show our DOD and IC sponsors that civilian students like you can make a meaningful contribution to problem understanding and the rapid prototyping of solutions \u2013 and, in the end, *deliver evidence of validated problems and solutions*.\n5. Fifth, we wanted to create the 21st-century version of Tech ROTC by having [Hacking for Defense](#) taught by a national network of colleges and universities. This would give the DOD and IC access to a pool of previously untapped, technically sophisticated talent, trained in Lean and Agile methodologies and unencumbered by dogma and doctrine. We\u2019ve succeeded. Hacking for Defense provides the DoD and IC hundreds of solutions to critical national security problems every year.\n\nOur mantra to students like you has been, \u201cDeterrence is not demos. Deterrence is deployments at scale.\u201d That means we are asking you to understand what it takes to get a product/service *deployed* to the field, not just have another demo shown to an Admiral or General. This has meant that the minimal viable products students like you have built were focused on maximizing their learning of what to build, not just building prototypes.", "page_summary": "This page is the foreword to the Hacking for Defense Manual, outlining the origins and goals of the H4D program.

But that single class \u2013 Hacking for Defense\u00ae or H4D \u2013 ignited a global defense innovation movement and continues to revolutionize the landscape of problem-solving in the 21st century.\n\nH4D is more than an academic course. It bridges the innovative spirit of students and the complex realities of national security. The program uses tools and processes that saw success within the National Science Foundation\u2019s Innovation Corps (ICorps) and the U.S. Army\u2019s Rapid Equipping Force (REF), which I ran from 2010 to 2013. Just as I saw at REF, where we worked at speed to save lives, H4D is proof that fresh perspectives and entrepreneurial thinking breathe new life into stubborn challenges.\n\nThe class has become a catalyst for change, impacting not only the U.S. Department of Defense but also intelligence agencies, diplomacy efforts, and even environmental initiatives around the world. At the same time, it\u2019s engaged a new generation of young technologists, giving them the tools and processes they need to change the world for the better.\n\n## The Genesis of H4D\n\nWe began in 2016 with a simple yet powerful premise: harness the creativity, energy, and technological savvy of our brightest students to address real-world defense and security problems. We took this idea and gathered other visionaries who saw the potential in connecting academia with government agencies hungry for innovation and used that network to build a scalable system that delivered value to everyone involved. I\u2019m proud of what it has become.\n\nH4D breaks the mold of traditional education, thrusting students into an entrepreneurial journey that mirrors the intensity and uncertainty of launching a startup. They grapple with actual problems provided by defense partners, conducting extensive customer discovery and iterating rapidly to develop viable solutions \u2013 all within the span of a single semester.\n\nThe impact of that first class was immediate and profound. Growing beyond traditional defense challenges, students now find themselves working on everything from space challenges for Space Systems Command to energy issues for the State Department, from advanced manufacturing quandaries to food storage logistics. These problems are diverse, complex, and critically important. All of this requires solutions to be delivered faster and more creatively than anyone had anticipated. We continue to hear again and again from participants that this experience has changed their lives and career paths.", "page_summary": "This page introduces the origins and impact of the Hacking for Defense (H4D) program, describing how it began as a Stanford academic course and evolved into a global movement for defense innovation.

H4D has fundamentally altered the landscape of national security problem-solving. It has introduced a new methodology that combines rapid iteration, customer discovery, and interdisciplinary collaboration to address challenges that once seemed intractable.\n\nThe success of that first class also inspired the creation of sister courses \u2013 Hacking for Diplomacy, Hacking for Impact, Hacking for Oceans, and more. The model proved adaptable, tackling not just defense issues but also intelligence challenges, homeland security problems, and even health and climate concerns.\n\nThe influence of H4D extends far beyond the classroom. More than 62 H4D teams have gone on to form dual-use companies after completing the course, injecting fresh innovation into commercial and defense sectors. Significantly, 41% of H4D alumni now work directly for the government or industries supporting the national security enterprise \u2013 a clear indication of the program's role in shaping the next generation of policymakers and innovators.\n\nThe program's impact is perhaps best summarized by a Stanford student who said, \u201cThis is the only course in my academic career that has allowed me to use everything I had learned at school to work on a real problem with real people, and that's leading me towards the type of job I want to have.\u201d\n\n## Looking to the Future\n\nAs H4D continues to grow and evolve, its future looks brighter than ever.

This kind of fight was one that Pete and I had first-hand experience with during multiple combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Steve was exposed to decades earlier while deployed in southeast Asia during the Vietnam conflict. Many of the problems and problem sponsors in our first cohort of the class at Stanford University in 2016 were influenced by the challenges associated with what at the time was termed the \u201cGlobal War on Terror.\u201d\n\nBut while U.S. political leaders and the American military focused on defending against and interdicting terrorist threats around the world, rival powers like China and Russia were actively seeking to undermine the U.S.-led international order through deliberate and concerted efforts aimed at leveling the playing field with the U.S., and wherever possible, tilting it to their advantage. For the first time since the start of the Cold War, Americans were presented with the real very real prospect of not being unable to prevail in a conflict. In 2017, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford warned, \u201cIn just a few years, if we do not change the trajectory, we will lose our qualitative and quantitative competitive advantage.\u201d Democracy and the rules-based international order were being threatened. It became clear to American policymakers that our national security challenge was the return of a great competition between world powers.\n\nI served as U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for South and Southeast Asia from 2017-2019 and supported efforts to develop the [2018 National Defense Strategy](https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf). In this strategy, then U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis urged that we view China and Russia for who they are \u2013 not who we wanted them to be.\n\nThere was also bipartisan consensus on the nature of the prevailing challenges in U.S. foreign policy. In March 2021, just weeks after taking office, the Biden Administration published Interim [National Security Guidance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NSC-1v2.pdf) admonishing: \u201cWe must also contend with the reality that the distribution of power across the world is changing, creating new threats. China, in particular, has rapidly become more assertive. It is the only competitor potentially capable of combining its economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system. Russia remains determined to enhance its global influence and play a disruptive role on the world stage.

The fascination began as a child: playing with GI Joes, making bows and arrows and slingshots, building forts, and \u2013 at times \u2013 fighting like the characters from William Golding\u2019s *Lord of the Flies*. Studying what war is, when it happens, and who wages it was my favorite topic in high school. In college, learning \u201cWhy do we fight?\u201d became my favorite topic because the list of reasons why humans fight is endless: war is hard-wired into the human DNA (versus nurtured), because of religion \u2013 \u201cGod Wills It\u201d (Pope Urban II\u2019s rallying cry for The First Crusade) \u2013 for \u201cprogress,\u201d technology, or freedom, or \u2013 most commonly \u2013 for the survival, power, and glory of the state.\n\nMy interest in the \u201chow\u201d question began under one of the most stressful, tragic and profound experiences in living memory: the terrorist attacks of September 11th. I was 20 years old at the time, and a sophomore in college. Like many campuses in the U.S., mine closed down for a week after the attacks. Several of my ice hockey teammates lost family members. My uncle had tickets on one of those flights (which, thankfully, he never boarded). The response by the American public still amazes me. Flags appeared at the front door of many houses. People rallied in a way I had never seen before and have never seen since. I felt deeply moved, and deeply American. I also felt an urgent, compelling need \u2013 a gut feeling \u2013 to serve my country. How, in other words, could I help?\n\nIn 2002, I graduated early in order to enlist and fight in the \u201cGlobal War on Terror\u201d and soon found myself in basic training preparing to become an Army infantryman. Soldiering came naturally to me and, next, I undertook Airborne training before being recommended for the Army\u2019s prestigious Special Operations Ranger Regiment selection. The process was bizarre, jarring, and \u2013 still \u2013 difficult to describe.\n\nIt felt like I had become a very small cog in an enormous and complex system. While I always did well academically and was reasonably athletic, Ranger training brought out my gross incompetence at performing any mechanical tasks, even fundamental soldiering tasks like disassembling and reassembling a rifle. I also met and was forced to work with individuals from backgrounds I had never encountered before. Despite differences in education, aptitude, and upbringing, most were motivated to serve in response to the terrorist attacks. All of us needed each other to get through the training. All of us were learning \u201chow\u201d to conduct war.\n\nAfter completing training, the 2nd Ranger Battalion in Fort Lewis, Washington, became home for a while. I learned how to conduct warfare via many special operations techniques before having the honor and privilege to put my training into practice during four combat deployments (Iraq 2004, 2005, 2007; Afghanistan 2006). I traveled in all manner of vehicles, from helicopters and boats to airplanes and ground vehicles. I fired a multitude of weapons and used gadgets I had only ever seen in those action-packed war movies. Most of the gadgets I was given were lifesavers. Others I was forced to use nearly killed me (more on this later). When not at war, I excelled in the schoolhouse, becoming the first person at Fort Lewis to graduate from non-commissioned officer school with over a 100% average. I also graduated and survived Ranger School (survived, not thrived, as I recycled twice) and went on to compete in the Best Ranger competition in 2006, placing 7th overall.

Entitled *Enhancing the Effectiveness of Private Military Contractors*, the thesis took four long and difficult years to complete. During this time, I learned, and eventually overcame, another very difficult process: how to write a high-impact, 100,000-word, fully referenced doctoral thesis.\n\nAfter graduating, I worked at RAND Corporation in Washington, DC, founded a mental health technology startup, and in attempting to make it profitable, learned of Steve Blank\u2019s Customer Development process.

Despite the popularity of the course, there is no accompanying textbook, workbook, or instructional \u201chow-to\u201d manual to guide students through the H4D problem-solving process. While there are several books on user-centered design in various disciplines such as Customer Development,[1] Design Thinking,[2] and Lean Startup,[3] each is written for various purposes such as business, academic research, and impact. None is aimed directly at solving government problems. I also wanted to help students focus on solving the Problem Statements they tackle in class rather than obsessing over the H4D process. Without a guide, students spend far too much time and energy learning the nuts and bolts of the process instead of solving problems for the government. Impact, to me, is equally as important as process.\n\nThe manual also fills a gap in the pedagogy of H4D by teaching user-centered design techniques that support student problem-solvers tackling government problems. The book shares not only lessons from the H4D classroom, but also my life as a student, Ranger, researcher, instructor, and entrepreneur.\n\nSolving governmental problems requires an understanding of the people, players, and processes *before* developing a solution. The book is built around three fundamental questions:\n\n1. What is the problem, who experiences it, and what are the pain points they experience?\n2. What potential value do government employees seek from a solution?\n3. How can solutions be delivered to the people that need them?\n\nThis manual is written for students tackling mission-driven problems in user-centered design scenarios or classes, such as H4D. It aims to help students determine the root causes behind defense and government problems, the intentions behind the behaviors, and how to develop effective solutions. The hacking tools discussed in this manual are vital to survive, prosper, and win any battle, including in the classroom! Learn the \u201chow\u201d and you will go far.\n\nInstructors and mentors teaching and supporting user-centered design, project-based, and/or experiential classes will also find the book useful as it explains how H4D processes, techniques, and tools can solve a myriad of problems. This group should also benefit from the extensive range of case studies, tasks, exercises, classroom examples, and real-world governmental problems contained in the book.

Able to pierce darkness, cloud cover, and storms, each satellite is smaller than a backpack, providing real-time high-resolution imagery and data twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, no matter the weather conditions. The satellites fly in low Earth orbit (LEO) some three hundred miles above the Earth, remain in orbit for roughly three years, and provide imagery updated hourly with <50 cm resolution.[4] The constellation provides U.S. government organizations, such as National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Organization (NRO), Defense Information Systems Agency, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, and the U.S. Space Force, allies like Japan and Ukraine, as well as companies across various industries with reconnaissance coverage and fast, direct access to mission-critical insights.\n\nThe company that operates the 10-satellite constellation is called Capella Space. Capella Space got its start in Hacking for Defense (H4D).\n\nBefore Capella Space, the U.S. government relied on a multibillion-dollar satellite constellation that used electro-optical systems. In 2017, the U.S. quickly realized the limitations of electro-optical systems when North Korea displayed its newfound ability to strike Alaska with intercontinental ballistic missiles with little to no warning. Existing satellite coverage over the Hermit Kingdom was only capable of capturing imagery during the day and only when the skies were clear.[5] Such coverage meant the U.S. was blind to North Korean activity for at least ten hours per day. The tasks of monitoring launch preparations and identifying developments to spot nuclear threat was, therefore, \u201chighly challenging.\u201d[6] Parts of the U.S. and American allies like South Korea, Japan, and Australia were vulnerable.\n\nThe U.S. needed to track North Korea\u2019s missiles on mobile launchers so it could establish an early-warning system. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the U.S. would require thirty-five to fifty orbiting satellites to make such detections possible.[7] The Defense Department also wanted satellite imagery capable of identifying launch sites, nuclear facilities, and manufacturing capability so it could strike preemptively should a launch appear imminent. However, a satellite solution was deemed prohibitively expensive, with the proposed constellation of twenty-one radar satellites costing between $66-$94 billion \u2013 more than $4 billion each.[8]\n\n**Enter Capella Space.**\n\nThe team that formed the company was enrolled in the inaugural 2016 H4D class.

The company developed miniaturized satellites to make reconnaissance faster, more powerful, easier to use, and cheaper (the per unit cost of a Capella Space satellite is $5 million, almost one thousand times cheaper than government estimates). Capella Space landed their first Defense Department contract in March 2017 for $10.4 million to develop small satellites using a radar-imaging technology called Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Additional contracts for the development and operation of the satellites would follow.\n\nIn 2020, Capella Space became the first American company to build and operate commercial SAR satellites. Capella Space\u2019s satellites are capable of seeing through clouds, rain, snow, foliage, camouflage, and darkness 24/7/365. Government defense and intelligence agencies use them to monitor important targets hourly across the globe, providing insights on troop movement, hidden tunnels and bunkers, military equipment mobilization, and even radioactive cavities left by nuclear blasts.\n\nCapella Space\u2019s satellites have been a game changer. Before Capella Space, SAR was not widely available or commercially feasible. Demonstrating feasibility changed how the U.S. government monitored threats and created commercial demand for the technology. In 2023, Capella Space services expanded to non-military projects. Clients now include commercial customers who need help monitoring the health of bridges, dams, buildings, ports, pipelines, and other infrastructure, tracking traffic patterns, and surveilling the growth of crops. The company offers both government and commercial customers unparalleled imagery, data, and insights. Capella Space is on its way to a $1 billion valuation.\n\nH4D alum and Capella Space founder Payam Banazadeh credits H4D for some of his success, stating, \u201cH4D gave me the tools and the structure to quickly and effectively iterate our hypothesis and narrow down our focus to the most critical problem backed by hundreds of interviews with real users.\u201d\n\nNot bad for a company that began as a class project.\n\n*Capella Space started out where you are right now.*\n\nCapella Space is but one example of many Hacking for Defense teams that used the class to create valuable solutions for national security organizations and commercial customers.

The renowned military strategist, Carl von Clausewitz (1780-1831), defined war as \"an act of violence intended to compel our opponent to fulfill our will.\"[14] Archeological findings indicate that the first wars occurred some 13,000 years ago, with the first war recorded by eyewitnesses at the Battle of Megiddo in 1479 BCE.[15] In total, \"14,400 wars have occurred throughout recorded history, claiming the lives of some 3.5 billion people.\"[16] War is occurring right now (in Myanmar, Ethiopia, Israel, Ukraine, and Western Africa, at the time of writing) and is therefore seen as a permanent, irreducible fixture of society.\n\nThe links between war, government and survival are inextricable. War, according to the famed Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (544-496 BCE), \"is a matter of vital importance to the state; the province of life or death; the road to survival or ruin.\"[17] In such a hostile, dangerous, and warlike world, the core function of a government is both profound and simple: to survive. To do so, a government must be able to defend itself (its assets and interests, both at home and abroad). This pursuit of survival has caused political structures to evolve from bands to tribes to chiefdoms to states as each structure provided the resources (land, labor, and capital goods, for example) necessary for militaries to address threats, thus enhancing the prospects for survival.[18] Correlatively, an effective national apparatus is one indispensable means of ensuring the security and survival of the state.[*]\n\nDifferent states have different attitudes, sizes, and budgets of armed forces. Some, the exceptions to the rule, do not possess a military at all (Costa Rica, for example, abandoned its army in 1948). However, governments more commonly possess vast defense organizations consisting of hundreds of decision-makers, hundreds of thousands of uniformed personnel, and billions of dollars. In 2023, the number and size of militaries worldwide has driven global defense spending to more than $2.4 trillion.[19] This huge budget also comes with a huge amount of complexity, particularly in terms of government departments, procurement procedures, policies, and industries. Such complexity produces bureaucracy, the central obstacle lying ahead of Hacking for Defense students. In fact, Hacking for Defense might as well be called \"Hacking a path through government bureaucracy.\"\n", "page_summary": "This page discusses the historical and ongoing significance of war, its deep ties to government and survival, and the evolution of political structures to support defense.

American forces are deployed to approximately 150 countries around the world and the Pentagon manages several hundred thousand buildings in more than 5,000 locations. It operates roughly 800 military bases and logistical facilities outside of the country. For comparison, there are merely thirty foreign bases owned by the world\u2019s other 194 countries. The Defense Department controls approximately 30 million acres, which is roughly the size of Connecticut.\n\nIn terms of budget, the U.S. spends around a trillion dollars per year for defense and national and military intelligence. To put the enormity and preponderance of the budget into context, the U.S. spends more on defense than the next nine countries\u2019 annual defense spending combined.[22] The defense budget eclipses the gross domestic product of countries like Argentina, Taiwan, and Sweden. Even Walmart, the world\u2019s largest company, earns less ($611 billion in 2023) than what the Defense Department spends each year.\n\n### Security, Survival, Bureaucracy, and Your Role\n\nThe U.S. has the most powerful military in the world.

It was created by industry and government leaders who wanted to introduce the successful process of rapid problem-solving from the commercial world to the defense sector. Serial entrepreneur and adjunct professor Steve Blank (the Godfather of Silicon Valley), Dr. Joe Felter (a former special operations colonel and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense), and Col. Peter Newell (a silver-star winning Brigade commander-turned entrepreneur), founded and launched the first class in 2016. Steve, Joe, and Pete concluded that the best way to develop the mindset, reflexes, agility, and resilience needed to solve national security problems in a bureaucratic system and cultivate the next generation of leaders is by creating and teaching an experiential class. That class is Hacking for Defense.\n\nThe title of the course is a bit misleading. Most assume that the verb hacking refers to the criminal act of illegally gaining access to a computer, network, or system. Hacking for Defense is not a course that teaches such dark, illegal arts. Rather, the word hacking refers to cutting a way through dense jungle, often by crude or ruthless strokes; in our case, clearing a path through the dense, foreboding jungle that constitutes government bureaucracy. With the title explained, what then is the correct label for the student engaged in learning the process of hacking? Each student is, simply, accurately, and best described as a hacker.\n\nThe Stanford course has proven popular, not only for providing students with knowledge but also for generating opportunities, projects, and partnerships that \u201cmake a difference\u201d to men and women serving the government. H4D is now taught all over the world. At the time of writing, over seventy colleges and universities on three continents have taught similar courses, of which there are thousands of alumni. In terms of impact in the U.S., groups of students have tackled nearly one thousand national security problems from more than twenty-five different branches of the government as solutions and over one hundred companies have been founded to do so.\n\nPersonally, I mentored H4D students in 2017 and have been an instructor since 2018, and I have always been impressed by the topics and aspirations of the class: impact, processes, networks, entrepreneurship, and rapid problem-solving. This class is different from other undergraduate and graduate classes. It involves more than books, ideas, and odd theories. H4D puts theory and practice into problem solving. It involves, in the words of Steve Blank, \u201cgetting out of the building,\u201d resulting in students having profound real-world impacts. The H4D class uses the Lean Methodology developed by H4D co-founder Steve Blank to facilitate experiential learning.", "page_summary": "This page introduces the concept and origins of the Hacking for Defense (H4D) course, emphasizing its focus on teaching students to solve national security problems through experiential learning and the Lean Methodology. It clarifies that 'hacking' in this context means overcoming bureaucratic obstacles, not illegal activity. The course, started at Stanford, has expanded globally and has had significant impact through student-led solutions and startups.", "images_interpretations": []}

It\u2019s not about rote memorization. It\u2019s about problem exploration, designing and inventing and iterating solutions. Experiential classes differ from traditional, directed learning classes where students are taught to remember facts, understand concepts, and perhaps apply procedures, but not to discover these by themselves. The process the experiential class uses is not linear. It is iterative; that is, H4D describes an approach to continuously improving relationships between technology, defense, and survival.\n\nThe course is unique in that students solve real-world government problems by placing the people facing those problems (and those that will ultimately use the solution) at the center of the problem-solving process. H4D mimics the uncertainty all problem-solvers face as they search for a solution while seeking to understand all aspects of the problem, not just developing the solution the government wants and then pitching or demonstrating it. H4D teaches problem-solving by combining theory with intensive hands-on practice. The class starts the students off with the belief that all the assumptions (and their Problem Sponsor\u2019s) about the problem and people that are facing it are simply hypotheses that will be challenged. H4D uses a flipped classroom approach where students complete tasks, readings, and interviews outside of class. Findings are then presented during class to the teaching team in the following format: \u201cHere\u2019s what we thought, here\u2019s how we tested those thoughts, here\u2019s what we learned, here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do next week.\u201d Forcing students to stop, reflect, and summarize their learning reinforces the key learning objectives, brings in the learning from prior weeks, and increases student engagement. These problem-solving skills are increasingly crucial in today\u2019s increasingly complex world.\n\n# H4D Process and Support Roles\n\nThe H4D process requires learning and applying clear labels to people and frameworks to differentiate between the needs, desires, and feedback of people representing different perspectives of the problem hackers work to solve. The book introduces and defines several labels, terms, and processes; all of which hackers are required to learn, and master. I know this sounds like a lot, and it is, but you, the hacker, aren\u2019t in it alone. The class comes with a host of support personnel hackers can leverage throughout the academic term. Usually, H4D classes involve people to help hackers throughout the process. Although the composition of the support will vary depending on each college and university, H4D terms, and the types of support commonly offered are listed in the table below.\n\n| Name | Definition |\n|------|------------|\n| Problem Statement | A Problem Statement is a one-page document outlining and explaining a government challenge from your Problem Sponsor\u2019s perspective. |\n| Problem Sponsor | A Problem Sponsor is the person who submitted the problem to the Hacking for Defense class and directly experiences the problem in their government job. The Problem Sponsor is the team\u2019s first point of contact to learn about the problem. Students are not expected to just simply follow the Problem Sponsor\u2019s direction but to use data collected from interviews to guide the process. |\n| Defense Mentor | A Defense Mentor is a person who has worked or is currently working in the government. Defense mentors help students connect and communicate with government interviewees and help students understand the problem from the viewpoint of a government employee. |\n| Business Mentor | Business Mentors support students by guiding them in learning and applying the Lean Startup methodology to the Problem Statement. They are also excellent resources for connecting students to people in industry that have worked on similar problems. |\n| Instructor(s) | Instructors are responsible for teaching the H4D process and offering guidance to solving the Problem Statement. |\n| Teaching and Course Assistants | Teaching Assistants (TAs) support class logistics. They are often graduates of the class and are able to offer insights on the process. |\n| Fellow Students | Students in the class are tremendous resources for offering candid feedback and connecting their peers to interviewees in their network. |\n| H4D Student Alumni | Chances are other previous H4D teams have worked on a similar problem to the one students are tackling. Seek out H4D student alumni for insights into the problem and potential solutions to accelerate learning. |\n| Interviewees | Interviewees are those that experience the problem (directly or indirectly) and/or are involved with either using or developing a solution. Each week students will be expected to test hypotheses about the Problem Statement and/or potential solutions by conducting interviews. |", "page_summary": "This page explains the experiential learning approach used in H4D (Hacking for Defense), emphasizing active, iterative problem-solving with real-world government problems.

An effective military comes from knowing how to effectively acquire and use resources (personnel, geographic reach, spending, and technology) in pursuit of goals. Bureaucracy can stifle the effective and efficient use of resources. The purpose of H4D is to arm students with the tools and skills necessary to hack through government bureaucracy to learn about the problem and then develop and deploy a solution to the men and women who need it the most. Student H4D projects are important because they create value for an organization that is focused on rapidly capturing value without always integrating that value with their needs. Consequently, a contribution by a single student or team in H4D can make a meaningful difference to solving governmental problems that enhance national security. H4D projects are valuable to the government because they help the government \u201csee\u201d what technology exists, and how it might solve any number of problems.\n\nWith that, let's get to work.\n\n# Application and Tasks\n\n## Task 1: Set up meetings with your Problem Sponsor and Mentors [30 mins per meeting]\nSet up a meeting/call with your Problem Sponsor. The goal of this meeting is to get to know them, absorb as much information as possible about the problem, and show them you are serious about solving their problem. Here are some questions to consider asking:\n\n- Why is this a problem for you? Could you explain what happened the last time you experienced the problem? How frequently does it occur? Who specifically is affected by the problem, using job titles and the names of organizations?\n- Do you have any real-world examples of the problem that you could point us to?\n- How often are you available to meet with us? Is there a specific block of time that best suits your schedule for a weekly meeting? (Note that each problem sponsor agrees to meet at least an hour per week during the duration of the course. Your question will gauge if you can contact them even more.)\n\nSet up meetings with any potential mentors or teaching assistants. Here are some questions for them:\n\n- What has been your involvement with the H4D class, the Lean Methodology, and/or our problem?\n- How can we best use your support?\n- How often are you available to meet with us?\n- What recommendations do you have for excelling in the class?\n- Who do you recommend we interview? Can you connect us?\n\n## Task 2: Name and organize your team [30 mins]\nH4D is a team sport. It is important to get to know your team, perhaps over a coffee, meal, or meeting to foster a sense of camaraderie, and give your team a name. H4D teams do not typically have a leader, and it is recommended to maintain a flat hierarchy with a distinct organization, roles, values, and expectations. Consider assigning the following roles:", "page_summary": "This page discusses the importance of resourcefulness and efficiency in military and governmental problem-solving, emphasizing the value of H4D projects.

Who will take notes? Some teams dedicate a single person to conduct all their interviews and another person to be responsible for taking notes and placing them in the team\u2019s shared database. Ensuring two team members are present for interviews (one for notes and one for leading the interview process) is absolutely necessary.\n- **Synthesis:** The Synthesis Lead reads through the interview notes, synthesizes what has been learned, and determines if hypotheses have been validated. They are responsible for updating the MMC and suggesting which hypotheses should be tested during the following weeks\u2019 interviews.\n- **Presentation:** A Presentation Lead builds a narrative around the team\u2019s learning by working with the team to create a slide deck. The Presentation Lead should focus on answering four questions:\n  - What were the team\u2019s initial hypotheses?\n  - How did we test those hypotheses?\n  - What did we learn?\n  - Next steps: Which hypotheses will the team test next week? How/with whom?\n\n**Task 3: Familiarize yourself with Chat4D [30 mins]**\nAs mentioned before, one of your greatest assets is the collective knowledge built up by past H4D teams, many of whom have probably reached out to or interviewed people you are interested in interviewing and combing through government documents. The Chat4D tool was designed to help you take advantage of all the expertise past teams gained through interviews and the mountains of defense research to accelerate your progress. Visit chat4d.io to access. Chat4D is not required but might be helpful for:\n\n#### Identifying interviewees:\n- Suggest roles and archetypes for teams to interview.\n- Look up organizations you\u2019re interested in learning more about or keywords related to your topics and identify interviewees that past teams have spoken with in the past. Looking through past interview notes can help you identify if the interviewee was forthcoming about sharing their perspective and can help you make sure that they are relevant to the topic you are trying to learn about. The fact that interviewees in the system have spoken with H4D teams in the past also makes them more likely to respond to a cold email because they are familiar with H4D and have demonstrated a willingness to speak with students in the past.\n- See how past teams have been able to secure interviews with diverse and seemingly unattainable people, which will widen your horizons of who you will be able to get in touch with.\n\n#### Synthesizing learning:\n- Autofill the Mission Model Canvas based on interview notes.\n- Output key takeaways from your interview notes.\n- Find common themes.\n- Identify quotes from interviews.\n\n#### Gaining background knowledge:", "page_summary": "This page outlines key team roles for conducting interviews and synthesizing findings, introduces the Chat4D tool for leveraging past team knowledge, and provides guidance on identifying interviewees, synthesizing learning, and gaining background knowledge.", "images_interpretations": []}

Complexity requires hackers to use conceptual frameworks and tools to help them quickly understand national security problems, determine potential solutions, and, eventually, work towards delivering these solutions to the government. To execute the process effectively, hackers need to first learn the conceptual frameworks that underpin the H4D process. This chapter introduces two conceptual frameworks, Customer Development and Agile Development, used in the H4D process. The next chapter will focus on the tools. In terms of application, two tasks are provided at the end of the chapter to support the application of the concepts.\n\n**Applying the Scientific Method to National Security Challenges**\n\nThe H4D process uses the scientific method to solve real-world national security problems. The scientific method is the gold standard for developing knowledge and has been (at least!) since Newton spoke the quote above nearly four hundred years ago. Leveraging the scientific method enables hackers to build on work already performed on a given problem or solution area. The format for the scientific method is **Hypothesize \u2013 Test \u2013 Result**. Two examples of famous scientists, their hypotheses, experiments, and results are provided below to exemplify the scientific line of inquiry.[27]\n\n|                | Hypothesis | Experiment | Result |\n|----------------|------------|------------|--------|\n| **Ivan Pavlov (and his dogs): 1903-1935** | If dogs are susceptible to conditioned responses (such as drooling), then a dog who is exposed to a neutral stimulus (metronome/bell) before it receives food will associate this neutral stimulus with the act of eating and begin drooling. | Pavlov and his lab assistants played the sound of the metronome/bell before feeding sessions. The researchers\u2019 goal was to determine if conditioning the dogs to link metronome/bells with mealtime would cause the dogs to drool and thus verify their hypothesis. | With repeated exposure, the noise alone made the dogs drool independent of the presence of food. By using conditioning, the researchers were able to make dogs respond to a neutral stimulus in a way that was both predictable and scientifically quantifiable, thus proving their hypothesis. |\n| **Merle Tuve (and the Proximity Fuse): 1939-1942** | German aircraft were decimating England during the Blitz in World War II: it took twenty thousand anti-aircraft cannon shots to shoot down a single German aircraft. Hypothesis: if researchers tried, they could build a sensor entirely capable of sensing nearby aircraft. If built, it would enable the Allies to shoot down German aircraft more efficiently. | Tuve\u2019s team tested several approaches using a variety of devices and materials. They shot them out of a cannon to test which would remain functional. Through trial and error, they found an anti-aircraft round and configuration that became the world\u2019s first \u201csmart\u201d weapon, called the proximity fuse. | Tuve\u2019s team validated that the proximity fuse could be built. Next, they validated its value. The proximity fuse reduced the ratio to one hundred to one, helping the Allies defend against Japanese kamikaze attacks and neutralize future attacks in England. |\n\nUnlike scientific experiments where variables can be controlled in a laboratory or when developing a specific solution, hackers operate in the chaos of the real world where they cannot control variables, nor do they know which solution they are developing because they don\u2019t know which exact", "page_summary": "This page introduces the conceptual frameworks used in the H4D process, emphasizing the importance of frameworks and tools for solving complex national security problems.

Steve realized that the difference between success and failure depended on *when* customer feedback was incorporated into the product\u2019s development cycle. Companies that failed had gained customer feedback *after* the product was being sold. Companies that succeeded sought customer feedback *while* the product was in development, and *before* the product hit the market. In other words, Steve\u2019s successes were characterized by using the scientific method to learn what customers wanted and then conceptualize and design products capable of delivering the desired value. Steve created Customer Development as a process of applying the scientific method of forming hypotheses, testing, and learning to entrepreneurship so entrepreneurs could capture knowledge and incorporate it into the products or features customers found most valuable.\n\nHacking for Defense uses Customer Development. More specifically, Customer Development helps hackers collect information about their problem, who experiences it, what those people need from a solution, and how to deploy that solution to inform which solution they will ultimately develop. Customer Development uses the *Hypothesize - Design Experiments - Test - Learn* framework (illustrated below). The process begins with hackers developing hypotheses about their Problem Statement, designing experiments to test those hypotheses, engaging with stakeholders to determine if their hypotheses are correct, and then analyzing the feedback to form new hypotheses before they repeat the cycle.\n\n![Diagram of the Hypothesize - Design Experiments - Test - Learn framework](diagram)\n\n- **Problem Statement**: Your problem is your starting point and often your reset point\n- **Hypothesize**: Develop hypotheses from your problem statement, research, and learning from interviews\n- **Design Experiments**: Build MVPs and create interview questions for testing hypotheses\n- **Test**: Test hypotheses through interview and presenting MVPs to interviewees\n- **Learn**: Analyze insights from interviews to determine which hypotheses were (in)validated\n- **Iterate**: Repeat the cycle by developing new hypotheses\n- **Solution**: You\u2019ll become an expert on your problem and the people it affects after repeating the cycle dozens of times. Once you understand who the problem affects, what they need from a solution, and how to deploy it to them, you can begin developing the solution.", "page_summary": "This page introduces the concept of Customer Development, a framework by Steve Blank that emphasizes the importance of incorporating customer feedback early in the product development cycle.

The purpose of Beneficiary Discovery is to help hackers broadly and deeply understand their Problem Statement before building the solution.\n\nLike the scientific method used by Pavlov and Tuve, hackers in H4D follow a similar format. They begin with hypotheses. A hypothesis is a concept that hackers will use daily to learn about their Problem Statement and how to solve it. A hypothesis, simply, is an educated guess a hacker has about something that may or may not happen when tested in an experiment. Hypotheses are a vital part of the scientific method of inquiry involving observation, inquiry (asking questions), and seeking answers through experimentation. Without hypotheses, Pavlov, for example, may have just studied the behavior of dogs without having a focal point of conditioning. The point is that learning happens when the effort is focused around a given hypothesis.\n\nHackers begin by making educated guesses (hypothesizing), then design experiments, test, and learn: Hypothesize \u2013 Design Experiments \u2013 Test \u2013 Learn. The process is iterative; that is, steps are repeated, which ensures that knowledge is built upon knowledge. Below is an example from the H4D classroom that will be described in detail in Steps 1 and 2.\n\n| H4D Team      | Problem                                                                 | Hypothesis                                                                 | Experiment                                                                 | Result                                                                                  |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Team Aqualink| Navy SEAL medics need a FitBit-like wearable sensor to monitor vital signs.| If a Navy SEAL diver is presented with a FitBit-like wearable sensor, then they will wear it.| Meet with Navy SEAL divers, show them a FitBit like monitor and discuss the value.| The team learned that Navy SEALS refuse to wear a health monitor and pursued another pathway instead.|\n\nIn the H4D example above, you will note the inclusion of a fourth column entitled \u201cProblem.\u201d Unlike scientific research with specific research questions and objectives, or traditional technology development where the solution is precomputed, hackers don\u2019t have a specific focus. Rather, they must find exactly which pain points exist within a Problem Statement and who experience them. To accomplish this, Hackers begin with a Problem Statement that approximates the problem they will go on to solve (more on Problem Statements in the next chapter). \u201cGetting out of the building\u201d is necessary to test hypotheses to learn who experiences the problem and the specific pain they face.

Agile Development is the name given to incorporating interview feedback into the design of a solution. Rather than conducting a single round of interviews, developing a finished solution, and hoping it delivers value, hackers use Agile Development to iteratively design experiments to test hypotheses about whether they are delivering the value stakeholders want and in a preferred delivery mechanism.\n\nAgile Development was created by one of Steve Blank\u2019s Customer Development students, Eric Ries. Eric went on to found the Lean Startup movement by combining Customer Development with iterative design principles adapted from the Japanese concept of lean manufacturing. Eric\u2019s idea was to operationalize Steve\u2019s Customer Development. While Steve created a process of gaining customer feedback, Eric created a process of incorporating that feedback in a systematic way. He developed a process of building early versions of a product based on customer feedback used to validate that the data previously collected was accurate. Eric\u2019s idea was novel because it argued that the design and functionality of a product or system cannot be known until customers engage with the product, provide feedback, *and* the feedback is used to engineer the product. The combined principles of Customer Development and Agile Development were spread through Eric\u2019s book *The Lean Startup*.[29]\n\nIn the H4D framework of *Hypothesize - Design Experiments - Test - Learn*, Agile Development is used to test hypotheses about whether a hacker\u2019s idea for delivering value to stakeholders is correct. Hackers test hypotheses using experiments by designing \u201cminimum viable products\u201d (MVPs) during the *Design Experiments* phase. An MVP, for the purposes of H4D, is a prompt hackers use to test a hypothesis. MVPs are not finished products. They are not even prototypes, since prototypes test how something should be built. Some hackers refer to MVPs as \u201cMinimum Viable Anythings\u201d because, at their core, MVPs are prompts that can come in the form of napkin sketches, spreadsheets, PowerPoint slides, pitch decks, physical mockups, or - more rarely - actual prototypes of finalized solutions. Hackers are even encouraged to use existing solutions as MVPs to learn about why they aren\u2019t meeting stakeholder needs.\n\nMVPs give stakeholders something concrete to provide feedback. For example, an MVP can be a visual aid that teases out key factors of why they like or do not like the product. MVPs can be contrasted with asking customers to imagine and offering feedback. The essence of the MVP is based on the business magnate Steve Jobs\u2019 comment that \u201cpeople don\u2019t know what they want until you show it to them.\u201d Jobs\u2019 quote is similar to one attributed to Henry Ford, when he argued \u201cif I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.\u201d[30] Hackers develop MVPs to test their learning. Feedback from tests informs the next version of the MVP in the Agile Development cycle.\n\nBelow is a dashboard MVP a team used to test the hypothesis that Beneficiaries would want a dashboard illustrating how quickly maintenance", "page_summary": "This page explains Agile Development, its origins, and its role in the H4D framework. It describes how Agile Development iteratively incorporates feedback into product design, highlights the concept of Minimum Viable Products (MVPs), and explains how MVPs are used to test hypotheses and gather stakeholder feedback.

The team then used the MVP to test the hypothesis using the feedback to iteratively develop the next MVP to test a subsequent hypothesis. The MVP elicited feedback from Beneficiaries which validated the hypothesis. The team then hypothesized about which aspects of the maintenance speed mattered most and designed subsequent MVPs to draw deeper insights.\n\nAnother MVP created by an H4D is presented below. This cardboard MVP saved the team thousands of hours and dollars. The MVP sought to test hypotheses about the team\u2019s understanding of what a physical solution should work. After testing with a dozen people that would use the solution, if built, the team learned that the MVP was too big and cumbersome. The team took the feedback in stride to develop a smaller MVP and retested it.

Once hackers establish hypotheses, they can begin to design experiments to test them in what H4D refers to as Beneficiary Discovery interviews. As illustrated below, one team\u2019s hypotheses and understanding of their problem changed as they tested hypotheses about the problem from week to week based on data gathered through interviews.\n\nWhen hacking, insights gained from testing MVPs often inform teams\u2019 understanding of problems and/or solutions, and guide hypotheses to be tested in subsequent interview rounds. MVPs elicit feedback that is employed to - again - iteratively revise hypotheses by making small adjustments (iterations) or significant changes (pivots) to the ideas that are or are not working. The cycle begins again with the team formulating revised hypotheses and developing new MVPs to use during the next round of interviews.", "page_summary": "This page discusses the iterative process of developing and testing Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) using Agile Development and Beneficiary Discovery interviews.

People with intense needs are willing to try anything, including *imperfect solutions*. Consider, for example, someone who is drowning. A drowning person has a single critical need: keeping their head above water. Being hungry, cold, or tired are all afterthoughts. Breathing is so important that if thrown a line of razor wire, they will happily cut themselves to the bone if it offers them a chance of getting to safety. A life raft would be preferred but their pain is so intense that they\u2019ll use anything no matter how imperfect it is.\n\nPeople with intense needs willing to try imperfect solutions will work with hackers through the *Hypothesize - Design Experiments - Test - Learn* framework. They are willing to provide the feedback necessary to validate hacker hypotheses, guide experimental design and testing, and will, ultimately, become the person who will use and benefit from the solution. After all, what choice do they have but to support the hacker or live with the pain they currently experience?\n\nThis chapter introduces five tools to help hackers begin identifying people with acute pain points: Problem Statement, Mission Model Canvas, Beneficiary-Value Proposition Canvas, Influence Map, and Workflow Diagram. Each of these tools will be used throughout the course to prevent hackers from viewing every problem as a \u201cnail\u201d.

Humans are hardwired to jump to a solution and spend too little time defining and understanding the problem. Each team begins H4D with a Problem Statement to help hackers focus on the problem. A Problem Statement is a one-page document that outlines and explains a challenge facing the government from the Problem Sponsor\u2019s perspective. It provides the necessary background information for teams to begin the H4D process which is classified into the following headings:\n\n- **Title:** The name given to the Problem Statement.\n- **Sponsoring Organization:** A one-sentence summary of the problem, the organization experiencing the problem, and the outcome they are hoping to attain by solving the problem. Note that if the Problem Statement mentions a solution, it is just the Problem Sponsor\u2019s guess at what the solution might be.\n- **Relevant Context:** 3-5 bullet points about who, what, when, why, where, and how the Problem Sponsor experiences the problem and the reason they need it to be solved.\n- **Impact:** The sponsor\u2019s perspective on why solving this problem is impactful beyond their own organization.\n- **Potential Beneficiaries:** A list of people, organizations, and job titles/roles that may find value from a solution.\n- **Team Recommended Skill Sets:** Suggested skills the student team should possess and potential directions the team should pursue.\n- **Resources:** Content such as readings, videos, and websites the Problem Sponsor suggests teams engage with to familiarize themselves with the problem.\n- **Problem Sponsor Contact Information:** The name, job title, organization, and contact information for the team\u2019s main point of contact in the government.\n\nBelow is an example of a Problem Statement.\n\n---\n\n**DoS-17: Caribbean\u2019s Clean Climate**\n\n**Sponsoring Organization**\nDepartment of State\n\n**Challenge**\nThe Barbados Office of Energy needs a way to harness existing renewable energy to reach their climate goals and strengthen their energy infrastructure.\n\n**Relevant Context**\n- The primary concern was exploring overseas to start renewable energy goals while identifying and nurturing Caribbean basin sharing future renewments. Approximately 10% of the energy in Barbados is generated using imported fossil fuels, due in part to ineffective technology, activity, and regulatory frameworks for renewable energy infrastructure. Moreover, existing power grids or technologies were poorly equipped, tightly isolated or housed systems that require significant upgrades to accommodate modern technologies.\n- This deficiency in grid modernization deters overseas donors and users from investing in energy storage solutions, especially for secondary populations or areas where connection terminals may not be necessary. Barbados, for instance, exhibits an excess of renewable energy that surpasses the capacity of their grids to absorb correctly. The bottleneck energy goals of the Caribbean, the rates higher than other parts of the hemisphere, pose a significant challenge. Such high costs strain citizens\u2019 budgets, impacting health, education, and overall socio-economic well-being.\n\n**Impact**\nIf this problem was solved it would aid Barbados in its transition to renewable energy, enabling replication in other Caribbean nations to foster collaborative efforts within the region.\n\n**Potential Beneficiaries**\nBarbados Citizens, US tourists, Minister of Energy\n\n**Team Recommended Skill Set**\nEnergy, Economics, Policy, Environmental Sciences\n\n**Resources**\nwww.state.gov/p/wh/2009/\nwww.eere.energy.gov/newsletter/barbados-demonstrating-access-to-renewableenergy\n\n**Problem Sponsor**\nOffice Director for Caribbean Affairs\nDepartment of State\nWashington, DC\nEmail: Cell:\n\n**Senior Leader**\nDeputy Assistant Secretary\nDepartment of State\nWashington, DC\nEmail:", "page_summary": "This page introduces the H4D Problem Statement tool, explaining its purpose in helping teams focus on defining and understanding a government challenge.

Influence Maps identify which organizations - the who - are involved with the Problem Statement. Teams then use another tool - called a Workflow Diagram - to map the process by which work is performed. Workflow Diagrams illustrate how a specific repeated task, or group of tasks, is performed and how it progresses. Diagramming work enables hackers to determine where pain points exist, what work is being performed, and which Beneficiaries are involved when the pain is experienced. Using Workflow Diagrams to identify the pain points in a Problem Statement is critical for teams to decide on which of those pain points they will address, and for which Beneficiary.\n\nYou are likely familiar with the concept of a workflow, even if you haven\u2019t developed one. For example, below is a Workflow Diagram for an H4D team\u2019s grades. The H4D workflow diagram indicates how information moves between entities and the role each plays in the H4D wider college/university ecosystem.\n\nWhile an Influence Map will detail each of these people and organizations involved in a class, the Workflow Diagram illustrates which people perform which duties and the relationships between them as tasks are performed. Therefore, Workflow Diagrams are built on Influence Maps by further contextualizing relationships in the performance of a task.\n\nDone well, Workflow Diagrams can also explain why a problem exists by linking a Beneficiary and the task they are performing with pain they experience. To continue the example, creating a Workflow Diagram might help hackers determine why their grade hasn\u2019t been reported by learning that the grade database is offline. Once a workflow is diagrammed, hackers can identify various pain points underlying their Problem Statement and determine which they will tackle over the course of an academic term.\n\nThis workflow becomes especially relevant when teams begin working on Value Propositions. Remember, a good workflow indicates different pain points involved in the overarching problem to be solved. The pain Beneficiaries experience will inform the value a solution must deliver. The benefit of creating a workflow is that teams gain insight into the execution of work leading up to the problem. Mapping the tasks in this way identifies the ecosystem.", "page_summary": "This page introduces Workflow Diagrams as a tool for mapping processes and identifying pain points in problem statements.

The idea was that if Capella Space could provide ISR, the 7th Fleet would be able to obtain details of surface ships operating in the South China Sea, enabling them to control which ships had access to the region.\n\nCapella Space began the class without knowing anything about the Navy or the Navy\u2019s problem. The team reviewed their Problem Statement and met with their Problem Sponsor. The team learned that technical limitations prevented the Navy from obtaining surface ship details necessary for operations. Existing government satellite coverage was limited because satellites could only see areas of the earth that were not covered in darkness or cloud cover. Therefore, only 25-50% of the Earth could be imaged at any given point in time. The 7th Fleet and several other government and commercial organizations wanted imagery 24/7/365.\n\n## Mission Model Canvas #1\nBased on the team\u2019s limited understanding of the Problem Statement and their meeting with their Problem Sponsor, Team Capella Space filled out their MMC before conducting any interviews or developing any MVPs.

As a result of the first week of interviews, Team Capella Space updated its Mission Model Canvas.\n\n## Mission Model Canvas #2\nThe main development was that Team Capella Space narrowed down their Beneficiaries and Value Propositions.

For instance, one Coast Guard interviewee stated they wanted higher resolution imagery to increase situational awareness. The Value Proposition for this Beneficiary was that higher resolution imagery enabled them to more accurately determine where a search and rescue mission should take place. Several other Coast Guard interviewees told Team Capella Space that they simply needed better tools to help them analyze imagery. Analytic capabilities would not only speed the process but make operations more efficient. After showing the MVP, Team Capella Space learned that Intelligence Analyst Watch Officers wanted analytic capabilities while the mission commander was interested in simply gaining higher resolution imagery.

Your grade does **not** hinge on whether you produce a solution. It is based on how well you use the concepts and tools to learn the root causes of the problem, who it affects, how to develop ideas for different groups of people, and how to deliver a solution by hacking through bureaucracy.\n\nI know this sounds like a lot. Take a breath \u2013 you are not in it alone. Subsequent chapters teach you everything you need to know. And, do not forget that you have instructors, teaching assistants, mentors, and fellow classmates to support you. The following principles serve as a guide:\n\n- Every H4D team begins with a Problem Statement. Use it.\n- Formulate hypotheses about that Problem Statement in the MMC. It\u2019s okay to guess!\n- Develop MVPs to test hypotheses. Set up interviews with people to use MVPs and test your hypothesis. (Hint: Don\u2019t interview a pilot if you are testing a hypothesis about a problem for submarines.)\n- Conduct multiple interviews with various stakeholders to identify competing perspectives about the problem and various solutions. Volume and diversity of interviews result in a welcomed volume of diversity of opinion which translates to a greater understanding of the problem (as opposed to one, parochial opinion).\n- The key to getting the most out of interviews is proper documentation and analysis.

One of the men, having grabbed the tail, says that the elephant is like a rope. Another, touching the elephant\u2019s side, says that it is more like a wall. The third, a man with his arms around the elephant\u2019s leg, insists that it is like a tree trunk.\n\nThere are many ways to interpret the parable, but for hackers the most relevant is the recognition that each of the men are right in their own way. Though each of their opinions differ, each uncovers some version of the truth. To see the bigger picture (or elephant) requires each man to explain their perspective, compare them with the others, and interpret them as a whole.\n\nThe importance of identifying, exploring, and analyzing perspectives also applies to problem-solving in the government. Problem Statements are initially written from the singular perspective of a Problem Sponsor. Yet, as hackers quickly discover, there are various types of people affected by the problem with differing perspectives within each Problem Statement. (For context, I\u2019ve seen hundreds of H4D Problem Statements. The Sponsor was 100% right only once.) Perspectives other than the Problem Sponsor\u2019s are revealed to the team through interviews.\n\nData is the fuel that drives Hacking for Defense teams to success. Interviews are conducted to gather that data. Teams interview to learn the who, what, when, why, and where of a Problem Statement before exploring how to solve it. Answering these questions from several perspectives on a Problem Statement requires 10-15 interviews per week to prevent hackers from \u201cblind man\u201d thinking where they base their decisions on a limited perspective. Interviewing one intelligence analyst, for example, only provides the opinion of one person; conversely, interviewing a dozen generates additional data points where commonalities can be identified and generalized to the broader population of intelligence analysts. H4D teams cannot precompute solutions. They must know the problem intimately before developing an effective solution, not unlike a locksmith must know what a lock looks like and how it functions before cutting a key.\n\nConducting 100-150 interviews in an academic term causes teams to become world-leading experts on their Problem Statement as hackers develop a unique grasp on all the various perspectives of the problem. It is not uncommon for people in the government to recognize the team\u2019s expertise and schedule discussions for them to learn from H4D students.

This chapter is a 'how-to' guide on interviewing. It answers the familiar questions hackers have about interviews and interviewing: How should I conduct my interview? How many interviews should we do? How do we source and conduct interviews? Who should we interview? And, how do we analyze and present our findings? It answers these questions by defining different types of interviews, offering templates hackers can easily apply to set up interviews, and provides examples of how previous H4D teams were able to conduct meaningful interviews to solve some of the world\u2019s most complex problems. This chapter is the last preparation chapter before we dive into the H4D process. Soak up the lessons offered here and prepare for success.\n\n## Different Methods and Types of Interviews\nIn the H4D universe, interviews are usually 'semi-structured.' Hackers, in other words, should strive to conduct interviews in a relaxed, conversational manner to garner detailed information about the interviewee\u2019s experiences. The process involves meeting people who are directly involved with the Problem Statement and can be useful to testing the hypotheses a team has about their Problem Statement and/or a potential solution. Feedback gathered from interviews is then analyzed to gain clarity on a Problem Statement, who faces it, various points of view, pain points, desired solutions, and relationships between people and organizations.\n\nInterviews take time, practice, and analytic objectivity. There are four H4D interview methods: in-person, video-teleconference (Zoom, MS Teams, or Meet), traditional phone conversation, and email/chat. When and where possible, teams should strive to meet with people in person - ideally in their place of work - and avoid phone conversations and email/chat interviews so they can witness the interviewees\u2019 body language. Even in the digital era, in-person, face-to-face interviews are a more effective way to build relationships.\n\nIn-person interviews are conducted in three forms: traditional, observational/site visits, and day-in-the-life interviews. Each is uniquely valuable.\n\n### Traditional Interviews\nTraditional in-person interviews enable hackers to read an interviewee\u2019s verbal and non-verbal language, and, in the words of Steve Blank, 'see their pupils dilate' when they get excited by the discussion and the MVPs shown. In-person interviews also generate additional opportunities. There is, for example, no better indication that a team is making progress than when an interviewee calls their colleagues over to check out a team\u2019s MVP or when the interviewee asks if they can keep the MVP. This can only be accomplished by conducting in-person or video interviews.\n\n### Observational/Site Visit Interviews\nIn traditional interviews, hackers gain a wealth of data about how interviewees describe their behavior and attitudes. Unlike reading books and searching the internet, interviews offer data and insights about actual behavior. Observation/site visit interviews occur at the interviewees\u2019 place", "page_summary": "This page introduces the importance of effective interviewing in the H4D process, outlining the need for good organization, preparation, and analysis.

Observational interviews also allow hackers to ask questions about the interviewee\u2019s work as it is performed. Such firsthand observations might otherwise take dozens of traditional interviews to piece together. One team, for example, only understood their problem after seeing firsthand how overwhelming it was for surveillance personnel to monitor six computer screens of 12-plus cameras on each screen simultaneously.\n\n*Figure: A site visit allowed one H4D team to witness the problem firsthand.*\n\n# Day-in-the-Life Interviews\nDay-in-the-life interviews allow hackers to \u201cget their hands dirty\u201d and perform some of their interviewees\u2019 duties. \u201cWalking in an interviewee\u2019s shoes\u201d also creates empathy, a personal, emotional, and experiential understanding of the problem, when it occurs, and how it feels.

Students will, therefore, likely only be able to perform one of these interviews in an academic term. Hackers should undertake day-in-the-life interviews _after_ they have an idea of which perspective of the problem they are solving.\n\nNo matter which of the three types of interview hackers and their teams choose, it is important to understand that the purpose of interviews is to learn about a problem, perspective, or idea. Again, the focus of interviews, and the H4D process, is one of testing hypotheses and learning about a problem, not selling precomputed solutions or ideas for a solution. The following content about interviews is broken down into five sections: requesting interviews, preparing for interviews, conducting interviews, and analyzing and presenting insights from interview data.\n\n## Requesting Interviews\nOne of the first questions hackers ask is how many interviews they need to conduct. Interviewing and requesting interviews is a numbers game. Teams are expected to conduct between 100-150 interviews in an academic term. Undertaking 256 interviews in nine weeks, while taking full course loads, as one team of four hackers did in 2024, is simply exceptional but proves that it can be done. Initially, teams will need to conduct 30-50 interviews to identify the various perspectives involved with the Problem Statement. Teams will then conduct additional interviews to better understand the most relevant perspectives.\n\nThe number of interviews required comes down to the size of the group of people, the Beneficiaries, the team is seeking to understand and solve a problem for. For instance, consider a team that is focused on the Navy SEALs. There are roughly 2,450 Navy SEALs and a good Hacking for Defense team would, therefore, need to conduct close to 245 interviews, or 10% of SEALs, to distinguish between opinion and fact to accurately test the team\u2019s hypotheses. However, if the team concentrates on SEAL Team 6, with a total of ~200 SEALs, then only ~20 interviews may be necessary. The number of interviews required to deeply understand a problem, therefore, depends on the size of your Beneficiary group. However, dozens of interviews are needed before teams learn exactly which specific group of people or organization they need to target.\n\nThe next most common question hackers ask is how to source all of these interviews. Again, it\u2019s a numbers game. No matter the number of interviews a team needs to conduct, they need to request three to four times more interviews than they need. The reason is that only ~30% of email requests to people hackers don\u2019t know and ~75% of people hackers do know will result in an interview. Outreach tends to fail for two reasons: The interview request is unclear and/or the request is overwhelming. Below are some proven tips and quick and easy email templates hackers can use to convert interview requests into real interviews. The tips and templates are divided into cold outreach and warm introductions.\n\n### Cold Outreach\nCold outreach is when hackers request an interview from someone they don\u2019t know and with whom they do not have any connection. Teams may", "page_summary": "This page discusses the importance and logistics of conducting interviews in the Hacking for Defense (H4D) process. It explains the value of day-in-the-life interviews, the need to focus on learning rather than selling solutions, and provides guidance on how many interviews to conduct.

However, using structured templates can increase the chances of landing an interview and save time.\n\n### Cold Email Meeting Request Template\n\n> Hi Major Smith,\n> My name is Ben Livingston. I am a student at Georgetown University where I came across your name (in the alumni association directory/Air Force Research Lab website/etc.).\n>\n> My team is working on [1-2 sentence problem summary] with [Problem Sponsor name and organization]. (Please see the full description posted below.)\n>\n> Your work at [government organization/company] addresses this problem/solution by XXX. We\u2019d love to learn about your perspective and experience.\n>\n> Would you be open to a 20-minute meeting at your office or virtual meeting at:\n> - Monday, 7/11 all day\n> - Wednesday 7/13 at 1pm ET or 3pm ET\n> - Thursday 7/15 before 12pm ET\n>\n> If none of those times work, I am happy to work around your schedule. You can also find a time on our Calendly, if you prefer.*\n>\n> Thanks,\n> Ben\n\n#### Tips for Cold Emailing\n\n- **Begin with the person\u2019s title.**\n- Note that the team writing the email makes it clear that they are not trying to sell anything. Be proud of being a student; it is an advantage and will open doors for you as your .edu email account and your status as a student ask people for help. Explicitly stating that you seek to learn from the person and are not selling anything (you shouldn\u2019t be at this stage) will boost your response rate.\n- Calling out your Problem Sponsor and the organization you are working with lends credibility to your project.\n- Paste your Problem Statement\u2019s \u201cChallenge\u201d and \u201cContext\u201d portions.\n- Unless you know the person, always suggest a 20-minute meeting. Everyone has 20 minutes to spare and people typically schedule in 30-minute blocks. If the interview is going well, you\u2019ll likely get the full 30 mins without burdening their schedule.\n- Make it easy for the person to schedule a meeting with you by offering three different blocks of time. Always specify time in the person\u2019s time zone.\n- Suggest an all-day availability, if possible, or at least two partial day availability. Select times within 10 days of the email. Don\u2019t suggest a time in the next 48 hours.\n- Some people like to use the Calendly app to schedule but don\u2019t limit yourself to it. If you decide to use a Calendly link, paste the entire URL. Do not embed it. Government servers do not allow embedded emails.\n\n### Semi-Warm Email Outreach\n\n> Hi Major Smith,\n> I am a graduate student in Computer Science at Stanford University where I am working on an Army project with the 18th Airborne involving satellite communication. I\u2019ve pasted the official problem below. LTC Jones\u2019 said that you are the smartest person in the Army regarding communications and had valuable insights to offer.\n>\n> Do you happen to have 20 minutes available for a [virtual meeting?](#) If so, might any of the below times suit your schedule?\n> - Monday, 7/11 all day\n> - Wednesday 7/13 at 1pm ET or 3pm ET\n> - Thursday 7/15 before 12pm ET\n>\n> If those times don\u2019t work, I am happy to work around your schedule. You can also find time on our Calendly, if you prefer.\n>\n> Thank you,\n> Sam and Team Flight\n\n- Chances are if someone is recommending you talk to someone, they had something nice to say about them.\n- See above template for additional notes incorporated here.\n\n### Warm Introductions\n\nA warm introduction is when students are warmly introduced to a potential interviewee by a mutual connection.

{"page_number": 63, "screenshot_filename": "page_0063.png", "instructions_model_received": "Extract book content and interpret images based the provided schema.", "page_context": "### Warm Introductions: Where to Start\n\nOne benefit of being an H4D student is that there are a range of places to gain warm introductions. Consider, for example:\n\n- **Problem Sponsor**: start with the 10-15 names your Sponsor provides. Ask each of those interviewees for introductions to 2-3 additional people.\n- **Hacking for Defense Network**: Use defense mentors and people with a .mil/.gov address to introduce you to other government personnel.\n- **College/University Alumni Association**: Every institution has an alumni association of people willing to help current students. Some of these people may be impacted by your problem or are developing products to solve it.\n- **National Security Innovation Network (NSIN)**: regional representatives can help you connect with specific defense organizations within their region.\n\nAlthough teams often succeed in finding people to warmly introduce them to a desired interviewee, hackers typically don\u2019t get the interview because the introducer fails to make the introduction. Why? Drafting a warm intro takes time as the introducer needs to articulate what it is that the students are doing and then relate it to the potential interviewee in a way that emphasizes the importance of them taking the interview. H4D students can help ensure the warm email introduction is sent by doing the leg work and taking the burden off the introducer by emailing the introducer a forward-able email. This way, all they need to do is forward it onto the requested interviewee or copy and paste the note into a new email. These messages include two parts. The first is a note to the introducer. The second is the email the introducer can send on to the potential interviewee.\n\nThe below is an email template students can model when requesting someone make a warm introduction.\n\n#### Defense Mentor/Problem Sponsor Introductory Email Template\n\nHi Colonel Jones,\nThanks for all of your support! Our team would be lost without you. We were wondering if you would be willing to connect us to Major Smith (who serves as [position and relevance to your project]).

You can also revise this short note to ask if they know anyone at a specific unit or performing a certain job function.\n*Some sort of sincere gratitude for their involvement in your work.\n*You might also mention their affiliation with the school, if applicable.\n*Best to specify a date within 10 days so there is some urgency but not last minute.\n*Send in PDF.\n*Paste their signature line.\n\nNo matter whether you are seeking interviews through cold outreach or warm introductions, be careful to avoid the following:\n\n- Don\u2019t overwhelm the contact by sending a long email. Avoid sending attachments unless you are being introduced by someone who knows the person well. You can provide additional information after they have agreed to the interview.\n- Refrain from embedding links in the email (government computers won\u2019t accept embedded links).", "page_summary": "This page provides guidance for H4D students on how to obtain warm introductions for interviews, including sources for introductions, a sample email template, and best practices for email outreach.

This is a mistake. Poorly run interviews lead to inaccurate insights, wasting the team\u2019s time, and burning a bridge because the interviewee will be unwilling to meet with the team again or introduce them to their colleagues for an interview.\n\nTeams often believe luck plays a role when interviewing. This couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Seneca, a Roman Stoic philosopher, statesman, dramatist, and author, did not believe in luck, and nor should hackers when it comes to interviews. Many of Seneca\u2019s well-known dictums remain as relevant today as they did 2000-odd years ago. A pragmatic individual, he wrote \u201cluck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.\u201d Interviews present many opportunities. However, the hacker will never be in a position to realize them, unless they prepare. Said differently, valuable insights do not simply happen by having random, unplanned conversations. Rather, hackers need to prepare for interviews so they have a clear purpose of testing specific hypotheses. Here is an example of what happens when teams rely on luck and/or don\u2019t prepare for an interview.", "page_summary": "This page emphasizes the importance of not sharing project details in initial outreach and highlights the necessity of preparing for interviews. It explains that preparation leads to better insights and opportunities, referencing Seneca's philosophy that luck is preparation meeting opportunity.

A few interviewees tell the team that their MVP is garbage because they don\u2019t understand the problem. Unprepared teams tend to either ignore hostile interviews, considering them outliers even though these are in fact truer than the other \u201cpolite\u201d interviews, or the team begins developing a solution to a problem 1 or 2 interviewees mentioned, despite knowing very little about the problem. Both courses of action will waste a team\u2019s time. Here are five vital preparation tips that can help teams prepare for a successful interview.\n\n### Tip 1: Determine which hypotheses to test in interviews\nInstead of fixating on who to interview, ask \u201cwhat do we want to learn?\u201d Teams should begin their interview preparations by formulating hypotheses to test before determining who they need to interview to ensure they are meeting with someone possessing information useful to testing their hypotheses. Before sitting down for the interview, consider which Mission Model Canvas hypotheses an interviewee can be helpful testing.\n\n### Tip 2: Conduct research to prepare for interviews\nAs discussed, the government and Defense Department are huge. To understand an interviewee\u2019s perspective is to know where they sit in the bureaucracy (rank/job title), which organization they serve, the role they play, and how they interact with the problem/solution. Knowing a little bit about the organization, as well as the person, helps students build rapport, develop meaningful questions, and not wasting interviewee\u2019s precious time by asking questions that can be answered by a quick internet search.", "page_summary": "This page illustrates a poorly conducted interview with a comic and provides guidance on how to prepare for successful interviews. It emphasizes the importance of formulating hypotheses to test and conducting background research on interviewees to ensure meaningful and productive conversations.", "images_interpretations": [{"image_name": "A Bad Interview (Comic Panel)", "description": "The comic panel visually narrates a scenario where a student team interviews an Army Colonel about a project.

The Colonel, holding a sign labeled 'MVP,' is asked if the solution is good enough, but he cannot evaluate it. The team misinterprets his responses, believing he likes their idea, while the Colonel internally feels the meeting was unproductive.

{"page_number": 66, "screenshot_filename": "page_0066.png", "instructions_model_received": "Extract book content and interpret images based the provided schema.", "page_context": "## Tip 3: Plan interviews in advance\nMost H4D class syllabuses require students to engage different aspects of the Mission Model Canvas each week. As such, hackers are required to conduct \u201cBeneficiaries\u201d or \u201cKey Partners\u201d interviews in specific weeks. Expecting to source and conduct interviews within a week is overly ambitious. Instead, plan by scheduling interviews ahead of time. Allowing busy, important people one week to respond is reasonable.\n\n## Tip 4: Prepare a strong intro\nThe foundation for a successful interview is laid in the first 5 minutes. Concisely reminding the interviewee about the project/problem, how it relates to them (or how you think it relates to them), and the things you\u2019d like to know about that person\u2019s experience sets the tone and provides context for the entire interview. By contrast, ineffective interviews begin by jumping straight into questions. Terrible interviews focus only on the team\u2019s idea or solution. Doing this limits the scope of the conversation by focusing only on what you mention and doesn\u2019t leave space for the interviewee to tell hackers the things they don\u2019t know about.\n\n## Tip 5: Encourage interviewees to tell stories based on their experience\nGetting the interviewee to tell you real stories helps hackers understand where this person sits within all the people/organizations working on the problem while indicating whether/how much the problem impacts their life. Listening to a story will reveal where the largest amount of friction is in this problem based on the emotional intensity in which they describe the problem. Moreover, storytelling often reveals information about the current solution and why it isn\u2019t meeting the interviewee\u2019s needs.\n\nSo, how could a team apply these tips?

As with all steps in the H4D process, there are some basic guidelines:\n\n**Get the ball rolling by asking basic questions about the person (name and where they are from) and their job (job description, years in position/field).** This is vital information that helps teams organize interview data. If hackers don\u2019t ask these basic questions, they won\u2019t be able to distinguish interview data between Beneficiaries and their perspectives. For example, if a team conducts interviews with \u201cpilots\u201d they won\u2019t be able to distinguish between the differing perspectives of helicopter, airplane, and drone pilots when analyzing their data. By contrast, recording an interviewee\u2019s job title will facilitate the identification of competing perspectives between airplane pilots trained to operate F-22s, F-35s, etc.\n\n**Focus the interview on testing 1-2 specific hypotheses.** Attempting to test more than two hypotheses muddles the conversation, making it difficult for hackers to determine how the interview data applies to a single hypothesis.\n\n**Encourage the interviewee to tell stories based on their lived experience** by asking, \u201cCan you walk me through what you do when you are dealing with [specific problem/task]?\u201d Try to avoid having them tell secondhand stories like, my colleague experienced X. If this happens, ask the interviewee for an introduction to that colleague so you can learn about the experience directly.\n\n**Ask open-ended questions.** Remember, the goal is to get the interviewee to talk about their experience. You want stories, so don\u2019t ask close-ended questions like, \u201cWhat was the last repair request you submitted?\u201d Instead, try more open-ended questions such as, \u201cWalk me through the last time you submitted a repair request.\u201d Asking questions that begin with who, what, why, and how are great. Avoid questions beginning with is, are, do, would because they form close-ended yes/no questions. If you do get a yes/no answer, you can always follow it up with a question to get them talking like, \u201cWhy is that?\u201d Don\u2019t be afraid to just ask \u201cwhy?\u201d\n\n**Ground your questions in reality.** Avoid speculative questions based on imagination, such as \u201cTell me what goes on in your head when a repair request fails to go through successfully.\u201d Try grounded questions such as:\n\n- Tell me what went on in your head the last time a repair request failed to go through successfully.\n- What are you currently doing to X? Can you tell me about how you perform this task?\n- Walk me through the process of performing this task.\n- What was frustrating or what did you like about the experience?\n- Have you ever had to perform the task with/without X?\n- What\u2019s stopping you from\u2026\n- What would happen if you\u2026\n- How would you improve\u2026", "page_summary": "This page provides guidelines for conducting effective interviews, emphasizing the importance of asking basic background questions, focusing on 1-2 hypotheses, encouraging interviewees to share personal stories, using open-ended questions, and grounding questions in reality rather than speculation.

First, close with, \u201cWhat should I have asked you that I didn\u2019t?\u201d During interviews we are all asked questions that remind us of some other nugget of wisdom. Some interviewees may not feel comfortable interrupting the interview to offer these nuggets. Asking this question gives them permission to supplement any of the information they already provided with further context. Last, \u201cWho do you recommend I speak to about this project and can you provide me with an introduction?\u201d This question will lead to additional interviews, referred to as \u201cSnowball Sampling,\u201d that is used to expand the network of potential stakeholders to interview. Try to gain at least two introductions from each interview conducted.\n\nWhen dealing with the government, there are particular nuances hackers need to be aware of, such as:\n\n### Email is the best method for reaching out to potential interviewees.\nMany government workers don\u2019t have LinkedIn accounts or, if they do, don\u2019t check it regularly. Hackers emailing people in government from a \u201c.edu\u201d email address have a higher chance of success. Good email discipline is vital: professional tone, language and signatures, correct military titles, and so on.\n\n### Culture, norms, and military etiquette\nThe government, especially the defense and intelligence communities, have unique cultures, norms, and ways of doing things. Show respect by referring to interviewees by their titles, and call officers Sir or Ma\u2019am and enlisted personnel by their rank, such as Sergeant. If in doubt, call everyone Sir or Ma\u2019am or simply ask people how they would like to be referred to.\n\n### Punctuality\nPunctuality is vital in the government, as is arriving before an interview. Most people in the military aim to show up five minutes early to a meeting. Many in the government believe that if you aren\u2019t early, you are already late!\n\n### Stay on time\nBe mindful of the interviewee\u2019s time. Do not run over, but if the conversation is going well ask the interviewee if they need to end the meeting at the scheduled time. Showing such respect sometimes prompts the interviewee to keep talking, or to suggest another date to continue the conversation. Both are ideal outcomes for inquisitive hackers.\n\n### Note Taking\nTranscribing interviews using AI transcribers is ideal. There are several platforms (my favorite is Backtrack[**]) that not only transcribe every word said in an interview, but also automatically generate summaries and key takeaways from the conversation. While helpful, it is important to ask your interviewee if it\u2019s alright to record the interview. If not, assign a person on your team to take detailed notes while another person conducts the interview. If there is only one person in the interview, make sure they write up their notes immediately after the interview while the information is still fresh.\n\n### Ask for clarity regarding buzz phrases and acronyms\nThe government, and especially the military, uses a host of buzz phrases (e.g., situational awareness, force multiplier, and common operating picture) and acronyms (e.g., Office of the Secretary of Defense \u2013 OSD). If the interviewee says something that you don\u2019t understand, politely interrupt them at that exact moment and ask what it means. After doing this once or twice they will start to unpack buzz phrases and spell out acronyms. If you don\u2019t ask, you could miss valuable information. You will find that interviewees will define these", "page_summary": "This page provides guidance on conducting interviews with government and military personnel. It emphasizes summarizing key takeaways and agreeing on next steps at the end of interviews, using email for outreach, respecting military culture and etiquette, being punctual, staying on time, taking detailed notes or using AI transcribers, and asking for clarification on buzzwords and acronyms.", "images_interpretations": []}
{"page_number": 69, "screenshot_filename": "page_0069.png", "instructions_model_received": "Extract book content and interpret images based the provided schema.", "page_context": "### Avoid scheduling multiple people at a single interview\nThere are times when interviewees want to invite their colleagues into the meeting. Though this might seem tempting and time-effective, if you interview more than one or two people at a time, you may encounter a hierarchy that you are unaware of. The hierarchy causes people to conform to what a more senior person is saying in the interview. This might happen without you knowing it, which could cause you to believe that all 5 people in the meeting loved/hated your idea when it might have only been the one senior person voicing their opinion and their subordinates not pushing back. Even when all people in the meeting are the same status, speaking to multiple people can result in group think, especially in rank-structured bureaucracies.\n\nIt is highly preferable to interview someone one-on-one because it will enable you to focus deeply on understanding one person\u2019s experience, which is difficult to do if you are speaking to multiple people. If someone asks about inviting others to the meeting, express your need to deeply and personally understand that person\u2019s role. Thank the person for their willingness to connect you to additional people and ask if they would be willing to introduce you to their colleagues/friends following the interview. If a group interview is unavoidable, follow-up with people individually.\n\n### Get to the root of why people are asking for the solutions they\u2019re asking for\nGovernment interviewees will tend to tell you what solution they want. For instance, several teams gain feedback from interviewees stating that all they needed to solve their problem was access to a specific product. When this happens, take the opportunity to better understand the value that your interviewee appreciates from the product to get to the underlying need by asking:\n- Why do you want that?\n- What would that let you do?\n- How are you coping without it?\n\n### Ending well by following up\nInterviewees take time out of their busy schedules to meet with hackers. It is important to follow up, show gratitude, explain what the team learned during the interview, and repeat what was learned. And, once more, outline the next steps in the process, how the interviewee may be involved and the next steps for the team. Below is an email template for following up which will increase the chances of the interviewee staying involved in the project and introducing the team to additional interviewees.\n\n#### Follow-up Meeting Template\nColonel Smith,\nThank you for taking the time to speak with us today.

Hackers frequently grapple with two questions: \u201cHow do I know if, and when, a hypothesis is validated/invalidated?\u201d and \u201cWhat do I do after my hypothesis is validated or invalidated?\u201d This section addresses each.\n\n## Knowing When There Is Sufficient Interview Data\nThe simplest way hackers know that their hypothesis has been validated or invalidated is that they hear the same responses to their questions and MVPs during interviews with similar types of people (again, recording who hackers interview is critical because it helps them isolate perspectives relevant to certain groups of people). For instance, even though F-22 pilot feedback differs from F-35 pilot feedback, hackers will know they have validated/invalidated hypotheses when the responses within those groups are consistent. Once a team gains this consistency from five or more interviewees in a group, it is time to start analyzing findings to validate and invalidate hypotheses.\n\nAs teams interview more and more people, they gain more and more insight. Some insights validate their understanding of the problem, while others will tear down the team\u2019s understanding. Some teams will realize they lack sufficient data to do whether and must continue testing. As such, there are three possible decisions hackers can make during analysis: validate a hypothesis, invalidate a hypothesis, or continue testing a hypothesis. Several questions are offered below to help teams begin interrogating the data to make one of these three decisions.\n\n- What did we learn?\n- What is still unclear?\n- How might we change the MVP to enhance clarity?\n- What further research is required to move the project forward?\n- What is surprising or counter-intuitive?\n- What have we learned that we know to be true, but we never quite thought of it that way?\n- What aligns with, and helps us, interpret a Beneficiary\u2019s past experience of the problem?\n- What is inspiring, moving, or meaningful?\n- What might help simplify and interpret other, more complex ideas?\n- What tickles us in some inexplicable way?\n- What speaks to our deepest goals, values, priorities, and questions?\n- What breaks or challenges mental models, conscious or unconscious?\n- What is rare, interesting, and potentially useful?\n- How, and why, do perspectives between groups of stakeholders vary?\n\n## Validating Hypotheses\nIf a team has consistent interview feedback from a specific group of interviewees, they can simply validate a hypothesis thereby turning it into a fact. When validating a hypothesis, hackers should update their MMC", "page_summary": "This page discusses how to analyze interview data, determine when there is sufficient data to validate or invalidate hypotheses, and provides guiding questions for teams to interrogate their findings. It also introduces the process of validating hypotheses based on consistent interview feedback.", "images_interpretations": []}
{"page_number": 71, "screenshot_filename": "page_0071.png", "instructions_model_received": "Extract book content and interpret images based the provided schema.", "page_context": "If a hypothesis is validated, hackers can do one of two things. First, they can move onto testing other unrelated hypotheses in the MMC. Second, they can design and test new or more specific hypotheses. For example, Team Capella Space validated that the Coast Guard was interested in commercially available synthetic aperture radar imagery. However, the team was unsure which people in the Coast Guard were Beneficiaries and why. As a follow-up, the team created hypotheses about specific Coast Guard Beneficiaries relating to search and rescue and tested them.\n\n## Invalidating Hypotheses\nIt is important to note that it is far easier to invalidate a hypothesis than to validate one. Receiving three to five points of negative feedback is enough to invalidate a hypothesis. Teams might also interview a senior leader or a subject matter expert who flatly invalidates their hypothesis. Corroborating such expert opinion with a single interview is often sufficient to invalidate a hypothesis. On the other hand, five to seven points of feedback are typically required to validate a well-defined hypothesis.\n\nSimilar to validating a hypothesis, hackers will know they have invalidated a hypothesis when there is consistent feedback from a group of stakeholders. Also similarly, hackers will institutionalize their learning by updating their MMC and VPCs. However, instead of boldfacing text, hackers will cross out the invalidated hypothesis.\n\nIf a hypothesis is invalidated, it is time to rethink or reframe the hypothesis, and the related MVP, and start again. Invalidating a hypothesis may feel disappointing but, in the long run, time, effort, and money are saved as the team pursues more meaningful problems with people with intense needs. Determining the next steps for invalidated hypotheses can prove challenging but, again, teams have 'been there, done that.' The table below outlines different options to overcome invalidated hypotheses.\n\n| 'Tweak' the hypothesis if... | Create a new hypothesis if... | Redefine the problem if... |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| An interviewee makes a suggestion that opens a door to other possibilities. | You invalidate the hypothesis. | You found a new problem that needs to be solved in order to solve the one you thought you were solving. |\n| You find yourself asking a question that begins with, \"How could I...?\" or \"How might we...?\" | You need to learn about another aspect of the problem/solution. | Your interviewees do not find your problem to be compelling. |\n| An interviewee offers a critique and you need to find ways to overcome the critique. | Your understanding of the problem/solution seems close, but not quite there. | You learn something that negates a core assumption being made in the Problem Statement. |\n| You know the root cause of the problem and need to figure out how to get around the known cause. | You want to test a hypothesis with different groups of Beneficiaries that have a unique perspective of the problem/solution. | You become so overwhelmed that you have to narrow down the problem. |\n\n## Continue Testing Hypotheses\nMore often than not, however, teams simply do not have enough interview data to validate/invalidate hypotheses and more testing is required. This means that students should be careful not to validate/invalidate their hypotheses based on too few interviews. Teams should always consider whether they have sufficient evidence.\n\nIn H4D, we say that hackers are winning when they are learning. Remember, constant learning is the goal and critical, even destructive, feedback on MVPs is valuable learning. Total failure only occurs when teams base decisions", "page_summary": "This page discusses the process of validating and invalidating hypotheses in the context of problem-solving using the Lean Methodology. It explains that invalidating a hypothesis is easier than validating one, outlines how to handle invalidated hypotheses, and provides a table with options for next steps.

Each column lists scenarios or triggers for the respective action. For example, tweaking is suggested if an interviewee opens new possibilities or offers a critique, creating a new hypothesis is recommended if the current one is invalidated or if new aspects need exploration, and redefining the problem is necessary if a new problem is discovered or if the original problem is not compelling. The logical flow guides teams through decision points after invalidating a hypothesis, helping them choose whether to adjust, replace, or fundamentally rethink their approach based on feedback and evidence."}]}
{"page_number": 72, "screenshot_filename": "page_0072.png", "instructions_model_received": "Extract book content and interpret images based the provided schema.", "page_context": "The bottom line with analyzing interviews is that teams will know when hypotheses are validated/invalidated when they begin to get the same responses. Teams will also know they are done interviewing when they run out of hypotheses to test (which never happens!). The trick for hackers after they've finished testing their hypotheses is to present their insights to the class.\n\n# Presenting Interview Insights\n\nH4D classes require students to regularly present their progress. Presentations are meant to benefit the team as much as it is to benefit the instructor. They are invaluable to hackers because it forces the team to critically review their learning and package it into a cohesive narrative. Creating and delivering the presentation, therefore, sharpens the team's learning about their problem statement and provides a forum for sourcing feedback from instructors, mentors, and fellow students which serves as a sanity check on the team's direction.\n\nPresentations are less concerned with subject-matter expertise and more about demonstrating that the team has been using the H4D process to make progress on understanding and then solving aspects of their Problem Statement. Unlike other classes, the purpose of the presentations is not to exclusively prove that hackers are experts in the subject matter.\n\nWhen preparing for a presentation, hackers should remember that they aren't being graded on whether they have the solution. Rather, the point of the presentation is to discuss what the team has accomplished that week and how they are planning to move forward. Hackers create quality presentations by narrating how they are using the H4D process by addressing four simple questions:\n\n- **What were our hypotheses going into the week?** It's important to make sure that presentations start each week with a presentation of the hypotheses that were tested \u2013 which is a form of \"Previously on...\"\n- **How did we test them?** That is, who did we interview, which MVPs did we show interviewees, and did we conduct, for example, site visits? Addressing this question sets up the presentation for this week's episode.\n- **What did we learn?** The meat of the presentation is explaining what they learned from testing hypotheses. Ah-ha moments from the week are discussed and poignant quotes, surprising data and interviews with influential people makes up the narrative. All information is not presented.\n- **What steps do we intend to take in the coming week?** Hackers should wrap it up with a preview of where you will be going in the next week. This is also the point where hackers can state the issues and unresolved questions they have by asking instructors, mentors, and peers for feedback. For instance, we know we need to talk to Navy submariners. Could anyone introduce us?\n\nHere are several presentation tips:", "page_summary": "This page discusses the importance of presenting interview insights in H4D classes. It explains that presentations help teams critically review their learning, receive feedback, and clarify their direction.

The slide below illustrates one team\u2019s slide that outlines their presentation. The team simply introduces the hypotheses tested during the week and high-level learnings. Later, they dedicate time to detailing their experiments (How did we test the hypotheses?) and learning (What did we learn?) by providing specific examples.\n\n> **Hypothesis**\n> - ?

Then test at training exercise\n> - Either decide as a team which direction to go, or poll\n\nNote how the team distilled the information into concise, easy-to-understand language to set the tone for the details that followed.\n\n- **Demonstrate creativity through hypotheses and MVPs.** There is no shortage of hypotheses that can be formulated or MVPs used to test them. Teams should focus their creative energy on these two areas. Don\u2019t try to be creative by jumbling up the sequence of four main questions.\n- **Even though it may be incomplete, explain the progress of hypothesis testing.** Talk about the Beneficiaries interviewed, the MVPs tested, and the major revelations.\n- **Focus on the most important information.** It is rarely a good idea to present raw interview data, or cram as much data as possible into busy slides that appear as a \u201cwall of text\u201d. Similarly, avoid telling epic stories about your learning journey. Impactful H4D presentations do not go into inconsequential details. Instead, focus the presentation on \u201cneed-to-know\u201d information; \u201cah-ha\u201d moments, profound insights, and tests, for example. Simply present hypotheses, major learning points, and critical insights in a neat, timely and easy-to-understand format. If the instructors want more information, they will stop the presentation and ask.\n- **Provide evidence of insights.** Evidence can include research, quotes from interviews, statistics, illustrations like Influence Maps, Workflow Diagrams, and/or photos.

The quotes articulate what the problems are from the Beneficiary\u2019s perspective and, at the same time, protect the team from being wrong in their interpretation of the data.\n\nH4D presentations are aimed at articulating learning. Explaining to the class what hackers do not know (as well as what they do) is an equally important step. It is encouraged for hackers to admit that they haven\u2019t finished testing a hypothesis or identified something that they know nothing about. Stating, for example, that \u201cwe learned that we did not know X\u201d or \u201cwe need to talk to Y people\u201d presents an opportunity for instructors, mentors, and classmates to offer guidance and connect the team to valuable interviewees and information.

The blurb will evolve as you move forward in the class and should be tailored to each individual interview request.\n\n## Task 2: Prepare an interview intro that provides context for each interview [20 mins]\nMany students attempt to get as much out of their interviews as possible by jumping right into questions. This is always a mistake. Instead, and in pairs, spend 2-3 minutes practicing the following:\n\n- **Genuinely** thank the person for their time (that is, mean it).\n- Tell the interviewee who your team is, which government organization you are working with, and what you hope to gain from the interview.

Labeled data is raw data that has been assigned labels to add context or meaning, which is used to train machine learning models in supervised learning. ODNI lacked labeled data in a classified environment as well as the personnel to label it. After carrying out 114 interviews, Gutenberg learned that there were tons of open-source data in the world, but intelligence analysts needed a tool to analyze it without classified restrictions. The solution: to create natural language-processing tools that enable real-time translation of open-source news articles in support of intelligence assignments.\n\nTranslating H4D theory into practice, the team formed a company called Vannevar Labs in late 2019. Four years later, the San Francisco-based company provides tools that simplify the analysis of data that have \"the power to prevent future attacks and defer future conflict.\" These tools are deployed to over a dozen government agencies and American military bases worldwide to support public servants making military and foreign policy decisions. The applications of these tools range from aiding intelligence officers in identifying data patterns, translating foreign languages, and searching for key documents to aiding decision-makers in countering maligned adversaries. The U.S. Air Force, for example, uses the tech to analyze technical documents about Russia\u2019s anti-aircraft systems. Vannevar Labs tech has redefined how the intelligence community engages information. The result is that more information is processed, more accurately, and faster than was ever thought possible. The company generates an estimated annual revenue of $11 million, and, according to Forbes, is on track to become the next billion-dollar unicorn startup.", "page_summary": "This page introduces Part 2 of the book, focusing on the challenges and solutions in national security analysis in the digital era.

The intent was for an operator to drive the camera around the inside of a building and identify threats before the assault force entered. It was supposed to reduce risk.\n\nIn reality, using the Eye enhanced risk. While the operator used the Eye to scout the building, dozens of operators were dangerously exposed to enemy fire as they waited for the building to be cleared. Making matters worse, dogs smelled us, began barking, and woke the neighborhood, causing us to lose the element of surprise. These factors combined meant that the technology made our jobs more difficult and dangerous, not easier and safer. It was less risky to enter the building without knowing who or what was waiting for us behind the door.\n\nThe major pitfalls indicated that Remington lacked a *holistic* understanding of Army Rangers\u2019 safety risks and needs. Had Remington followed the H4D process, they would have understood *who* would be using the Eye and *what* we needed to perform our jobs.

At the beginning of the class, hackers and their teams are instructed to interview a variety of people involved with their Problem Statement. Interviewing people from the government, academia, and industry informs hackers who experience the Problem Statement and helps them identify potential Beneficiaries.

There are two key characteristics of a Beneficiary:\n\n1. A Beneficiary is the person, or group of people, who benefits from the solution a team develops, whether that is a product, service, or policy proposal. People and organizations unaffected by a Problem Statement are not Beneficiaries.\n2. Beneficiaries share the same perspective. They have common goals, perform similar tasks, have similar responsibilities, and experience the same intense needs in similar, if not identical, ways. The need for a shared perspective among Beneficiaries means they are characterized by relatively small organizations and/or people that share job titles.\n\n**Example:**\n- \u201cNavy SEAL divers\u201d are a good example of a Beneficiary because they share a singular perspective of a problem as they come from the same organization, perform the same job, and have a similar job title.\n- \u201cThe U.S. Navy\u201d is a bad example because it is a large organization with many roles, making it impossible to specify who benefits from a solution.\n- Broad organizations like the U.S. Navy are poor examples because they contain multiple perspectives (SEAL divers, submariners, F-35 pilots, engineers, etc.).\n\nEvery Problem Statement has several potential Beneficiaries with competing perspectives that define the same Problem Statement differently, much like the blind men in the Indian parable. The more perspectives identified, the better the team will understand the problem and can be more selective about which need to solve and for whom.\n\n## End-Users and Decision-Makers\n\nThe key to delivering a solution lies in identifying two types of Beneficiaries:\n- **End-Users:** Government employees who use and directly benefit from a solution.\n- **Decision-Makers:** Leaders who decide which solutions End-Users use and indirectly benefit from a solution being used.\n\n**Example:**\nA Decision-Maker in the Pentagon might approve a purchase request for a shovel to be used by an infantryman (End-User) in the Middle East. The End-User directly benefits from the new shovel by using it in combat positions. The Decision-Maker, who made the purchase request, indirectly benefits because it helps achieve the objective of controlling land. Thus, the shovel benefits both End-Users (directly) and Decision-Makers (indirectly), offering unique value to each.", "page_summary": "This page explains the importance of identifying Beneficiaries when solving government problems, emphasizing that Beneficiaries are those who benefit from a solution and share a common perspective.

This is a mistake. Creating value exclusively for the End-User is insufficient for success because End-Users rarely decide which solutions are used. To be successful, teams must satisfy both End-Users (or they won\u2019t use it) and Decision-Makers (or they won\u2019t authorize its purchase and use). Teams must, therefore, deeply understand who End-Users and Decision-Makers are (down to their job titles), what intense needs they experience from the Problem Statement, and the value required to address those needs. Then, and only then, can a team begin developing a solution capable of delivering value to End-Users and Decision-Makers. Creating Influence Maps (introduced in the H4D Toolkit chapter) is the single most useful tool for identifying Beneficiaries involved in a Problem Statement. The Aqualink case study illustrates the importance of identifying Beneficiaries and how the team used an Influence Map to do so.\n\n## Case Study: Team Aqualink (Part I)\nNaval Special Warfare Group 3 (NSWG-3) had a problem. SEAL divers were experiencing the dreaded bends and getting sick after spending too much time deep underwater. The Problem Sponsor, a NSWG-3 Navy Dive Medical Officer, wanted Team Aqualink to develop a FitBit-like wearable sensor for divers so medics could identify the early warning signs of health issues. The Problem Sponsor had simplified the Problem Statement: \u201cDivers get sick. A wearable sensor will help determine when divers are at risk of being sick. Therefore, developing a wearable sensor will decrease diver health issues.\u201d\n\nTeam Aqualink\u2019s Problem Statement was clear, thoughtful, and simple. However, both the problem and solution proved to be far more complex. It was only after three weeks and forty interviews that Aqualink discovered the real problem for which the wearable device was not a solution at all. The team made this realization by focusing on who experienced the problem (the focus of this case study) and what Beneficiaries needed from a solution (the focus of next chapter\u2019s case study).\n\nHere\u2019s their story.\n\n### Identify Beneficiaries\nWhen Aqualink started the H4D process, they were determined to build the wearable sensor requested by their Problem Sponsor, a so-called *FitBit for divers*. The team believed the Problem Sponsor understood the problem and, therefore, knew the solution. Aqualink began by filling in their Mission Model Canvas directly in line with their Sponsor\u2019s perspective.\n\nThen, the process began to stall. It stalled because Aqualink grew obsessed with creating a *FitBit for divers* and solving a problem they did not fully understand. The problem Aqualink faced, and the issue all hackers face when attempting to build a solution at the outset, is that hackers assume that the Problem Sponsor knows who needs the solution, and what exactly they need. (Spoiler alert: Problem Sponsors rarely know who and what!) It\u2019s not that the Problem Sponsors have done anything wrong, it is just that they view the problem from only one of several different perspectives. In attempting to develop a solution straightaway, Aqualink was betting hundreds of work hours on their Problem Sponsor\u2019s perspective being 100% correct when experience shows that they are right less than 1% of the time.", "page_summary": "This page discusses the importance of identifying both End-Users and Decision-Makers when developing solutions, using Team Aqualink's case study as an example. It highlights the pitfalls of focusing solely on the Problem Sponsor's perspective and the need to deeply understand who experiences the problem and what beneficiaries actually need.

They began by asking themselves, \u201cWho is affected by our Problem Statement?\u201d Aqualink guessed that NSWG-3 divers, commercial divers, and diver research organizations were all potential Beneficiaries, since they could all potentially wear the sensor benefit from mitigating the health risks of diving. Aqualink revised their MMC to include non-SEAL military divers and commercial and scientific divers as shown below.\n\n**Beneficiaries**\n- End-Users in NSWG3 and other military divers\n- Military diver-related research organizations e.g. NEDU, SOCOM HPRC, NUMI\n\n**Secondary I:**\n- Commercial saturation divers (in particular the offshore oil/gas industry)\n- The broader technical/scientific diving community\n\nTo gain a more nuanced understanding of the Beneficiaries, Aqualink created an Influence Map to begin identifying who their potential Beneficiaries were and how they related to one another, if at all.

Roughly half of their 20 Naval Special Warfare Group (NSWG) interviewees wanted a wearable sensor, and the others didn\u2019t. One interviewee hated the idea of wearing a sensor so much he stated, \u201cIf you gave me the sensor right now, it would be at the bottom of the ocean in five minutes.\u201d The team couldn\u2019t make sense of the conflicting interview data.\n\nAs Aqualink discussed their Influence Map and the conflicting interview data during their weekly presentation, they had an epiphany: the only Beneficiary depicted on the Influence Map was NSWG but their presentation talked about Navy SEAL Dive Medical Officers and SEAL Divers, not NSWG. The team realized that NSWG wasn\u2019t a Beneficiary. Rather, NSWG consisted of at least two distinct Beneficiaries: dive medics and divers.\n\nIn terms of learning, this realization proved seminal. Until this point, Aqualink thought of Beneficiaries only as End-Users, or the divers who would physically wear their solution. They did not realize that their Problem Sponsor, the dive medics, were also Beneficiaries and, more specifically, Decision-Makers. Realizing that divers and dive medics were distinct Beneficiary groups also explained why Aqualink was getting conflicting data from their interviews. Each had a unique perspective of the problem and, consequently, about the solution. SEAL divers did not want to wear the sensor. Dive medics did. Identifying these two perspectives meant that Aqualink was well on their way to determining their Beneficiaries.\n\nSo, did they build a solution? Did it work? Hold on just a second.\n\nAt this stage in the H4D process, it is important to identify Beneficiaries and their relationship to one another by creating an Influence Map. Doing so helped Aqualink begin identifying the multiple perspectives involved with their Problem Statement. After determining who, the next step for Aqualink was to determine what intense needs their Beneficiaries possessed. Step 2: Value Propositions returns to the Aqualink case.\n\n### Guiding Principles for Determining Beneficiaries\n\n- A Beneficiary is the person, or group of people, who benefit from the solution a team develops, whether that is a product, service, or policy proposal.\n- Step 1 of the H4D process identifies everyone that could be impacted by your Problem Statement.\n- There are two types of Beneficiaries required to deliver a solution: End-Users who will use and directly benefit from a solution, and Decision-Makers who have the authority to decide which solutions get adopted.\n- Influence Maps are essential to identifying Beneficiaries and their relationships to one another. Use Influence Maps as MVPs during interviews to test Beneficiary hypotheses, identify unique Beneficiary perspectives, and develop an understanding of each Beneficiary\u2019s point of view, as well as relationships between Beneficiaries.\n- Add and eliminate Beneficiaries from your Influence Map and MMC based on at least 3-5 interviews. Don\u2019t rely on one person\u2019s opinion. This is one reason teams are both encouraged and expected to conduct ten to fifteen interviews per week (at least!).\n\nSee commonmission.us/h4d-manual for examples of Beneficiaries slides.", "page_summary": "This page discusses Aqualink's process of identifying their true Beneficiaries by analyzing conflicting interview data and using Influence Maps.

Of the organizations an interviewee points out, ask if they could introduce you to people in that organization to interview.\n\nConsider asking your interviewees the questions you used during your Problem Sponsor discussion in the H4D Toolkit chapter.

Why/How are they impacted? (I.e., describe the problem(s) they face with the existing capability.)\n- Which Beneficiaries (e.g., job descriptions/people or organizations) are indirectly impacted by the current capability\u2019s shortcomings (i.e., Decision-Makers)?

Identifying what Beneficiaries need is the second most critical component of the H4D process.

Write a one-sentence statement articulating your current understanding of the problem from that Beneficiary\u2019s perspective.

To protect itself from Soviet aggression, the U.S. sought the ability to deliver nuclear warheads deep into Soviet territory since bombers and missiles weren\u2019t able to fly from the U.S. into the USSR. The famous, and then Top Secret, report by Albert Wohlstetter and his RAND Corporation team offered recommendations for delivering nuclear payloads which formed the backbone of the U.S. government\u2019s deterrence strategy.\n\nAfter learning *who* the Air Force Beneficiary was, Wohlstetter realized he didn\u2019t know the specifics of what a deep strike capability would need to achieve or how success would be measured. His team tackled the problem by characterizing *what* intense needs his Beneficiary faced by learning about important metrics like campaign objectives and aircraft sortie rates.[41] They conducted interviews and analysis of air base infrastructure and aircraft design (e.g., range, speed, and payload) to understand why existing solutions were falling short.[42] Once Wohlstetter\u2019s team was able to characterize the *who, what,* and *why*, they brainstormed several potential solutions. These solutions were then narrowed down based on potential Soviet responses, such as adversary actions and force vulnerabilities.[43]\n\nAfter months of interviews and analysis using the iterative approach of determining *who* was the Beneficiary, *what* the Air Force needed, and *why* limitations existed, Wohlstetter knew exactly *what* value the Air Force needed to unlock a deep strike capability and recommended three solutions for *how* to deliver that value. The first option repositioned aircraft overseas where they would be closer to the Soviet border. The second option based aircraft in the U.S. and refueled them by air while enroute to the USSR. The third option was a combination of the first two options *where* aircraft would be based in the U.S. and refueled on the ground at forward bases. The Air Force would go on to implement the third option, which supported the U.S. achieving victory in the Cold War.\n\nThe point of this story is simple: Locksmiths must see the lock before making a key to fit it. Like a locksmith, Wohlstetter\u2019s team needed to understand the details of the problem, the value desired, and the limitations of potential solutions before developing recommendations to unlock value for the Air Force. Problem-solving is an iterative process where hackers must determine *who* the Beneficiary is before learning what intense needs they have. Determining \u201cwhat intense needs\u201d requires hackers to understand the specifics of the task the Beneficiary is attempting to perform, the difficulties they experience performing it, and the value they need to unlock to accomplish the task, *before* considering solutions that will deliver the value. Step 2 is dedicated to determining what intense needs End-Users have and isolating the corresponding value that will satisfy those needs.

Optimizing performance, saving time and money, or enhancing satisfaction are all VPs. VPs are not solutions, products (software/hardware), services, or policy papers. Rather, End-Users seek solutions because they deliver the VPs needed to perform a task. Take Unmanned Aerial Systems, commonly referred to as drones, for example. Drones deliver Value Propositions such as providing intelligence, delivering equipment, and attacking the enemy. Drones, as with any solution, are the vehicle for which VPs are transferred to the End-User. Each one of the VPs it delivers could be delivered by something else. Intelligence, for example, could be collected by satellites or piloted aircraft or spies. Same \u201cintelligence\u201d VP, different solution delivering it. To repeat, products (software/hardware), services, and policy papers are not VPs. They are solutions that deliver VPs. As the Einstein quote and the Wohlstetter example suggest, determining End-User needs and determining which value satisfies those needs precedes the development of a successful solution.\n\nThere are an infinite number of VPs End-Users can want. Hackers must understand End-User perspectives so deeply that they can recognize which VPs are nice-to-have and which are need-to-have when addressing an End-User\u2019s intense need. Nice-to-have VP's deliver lesser value to End-Users. Although desirable, they don't satisfy an intense need. By contrast, need-to-have VPs directly satisfy End-User needs to complete essential tasks. As such, like Wohlstetter or a locksmith, hackers must first understand what value they are attempting to unlock before developing the solutions to unlock it.\n\nSome hackers attempt to create a solution before knowing which VPs Beneficiaries need. H4D refers to the development of a solution before understanding Beneficiary needs as \u201csolutioneering.\u201d Solutioneering is a problem because hackers will need to present their solution to many potential Beneficiaries hoping one will like it. Hackers engaged in solutioneering effectively make a key and move from one lock to the next hoping the key will work. This approach is closer to guessing than problem-solving because the solution is not designed to add a particular increment of value to a specific Beneficiary. Successful H4D teams avoid solutioneering by using the Beneficiary Value Proposition Canvas to deeply understand each Beneficiaries' unique needs.

Hackers must be very specific on who the Beneficiaries are as each has different needs, and therefore, requires different Value Propositions. Aqualink was only able to distinguish who needed what. Part II explains how Aqualink went from identifying who their Beneficiaries were to determining what VPs End-Users need by separating Divers from Medics.

Team Aqualink first investigated what SEAL Medical Dive Officers needed by conducting interviews. After gathering interview data from medics, Aqualink filled out the Beneficiary Profile circle on the right-hand side of the Beneficiary Value Proposition Canvas as seen below. The list included keeping SEALs healthy, mitigating short- and long-term safety issues, and generating diver health data.\n\nIn addition, Aqualink began to brainstorm ideas about what value could address Dive Medical Officer needs by completing the square Value Map on the left-hand side of the VPC. It was straightforward since Aqualink already knew that medics wanted a \u201cFitBit-like sensor.\u201d Aqualink guessed when they lacked information.\n\nCreating a Beneficiary Profile (the circle) enabled Aqualink to effectively filter and sort their interview data, deepen their understanding of what medics wanted from a wearable sensor, and how that value translated into performance. For example, after completing the VPC Aqualink recognized that the primary medic task was keeping divers healthy. All the other tasks stemmed from this. In terms of gains, medics sought to reduce, prevent, and, where possible, predict diver health issues. The pain points and intense needs Aqualink recorded clearly indicated that divers being underwater for long periods was the most significant inhibiting factor for keeping divers healthy.\n\nIn the square Value Map (the square), Aqualink included VPs they heard during interviews and some that they created themselves in the Gain Creator and Pain Reliever sections.

The team attempted to complete diver tasks, pains, and gains only to realize that everything they knew about divers was from the medics. As such, the Diver Profile looked a lot like the Medic Profile. Filling out the diver VPC led Aqualink to an \u201cah-ha\u201d moment. Even though they realized that dive medics and divers were two distinct groups, they now recognized that they knew very little about divers and the tasks they performed.\n\nAqualink knew they needed to get firsthand information about diver needs directly from divers. The team focused on conducting diver interviews. After only a couple of interviews, Aqualink learned that medics and divers performed different tasks and experienced unique pains and gains in performing those tasks. Fresh inputs from Beneficiaries confirmed that medics cared most, and exclusively, about diver health. Surprisingly, Aqualink also learned that divers didn\u2019t care about health. Aqualink needed to do more interviews to learn exactly what divers did care about.\n\n## Deepen End-User Understanding by Creating Beneficiary Archetypes\n\nAqualink realized if they got to know the Beneficiary better, they would more deeply understand their perspective. The team created a Beneficiary Archetype for SEAL divers. A Beneficiary Archetype is a tool that describes a person within a Beneficiary group. The term \u201carchetype\u201d is just a fancy word for zooming in to understand a specific Beneficiary from a solution from an intimate and personal level.\n\nAqualink characterized SEAL divers by gender, age, personality characteristics, and professional focus and named the diver archetype \u201cMatt,\u201d which was a name common to the diver community. Establishing \u201cMatt\u201d as a Beneficiary Archetype proved critical because learning about divers at a personal level added context about the divers they only understood from interactions with medics.", "page_summary": "This page discusses how Aqualink realized the importance of directly interviewing SEAL divers to understand their unique needs, pains, and gains, rather than relying solely on information from medics.

It wasn\u2019t that divers didn\u2019t care about health, they did, they just cared more about the mission, causing their own health and well-being to be secondary, or even tertiary, concerns.\n\n## Using a Workflow Diagram to Determine When and Where Intense Needs Exist\n\nThe question hanging over Aqualink was, \u201cWhat is the diver\u2019s mission?\u201d It was clearly the most important thing to their diver beneficiary, yet they knew nothing about it. Aqualink needed more detail around the primary task divers perform. More specifically, they needed to understand what was involved in the task and **when and where** it was performed so Aqualink could isolate the point divers felt the intense needs the Aqualink solution would address. The team created a Workflow Diagram. They began by outlining the process divers use to perform their most important task: executing a mission.\n\n1. Divers deploy a SEAL Delivery Vehicle (SDV) from a submarine.\n2. Divers leave the SDV to swim to their destination to complete a particular mission.\n3. Once the mission is complete, the divers return to the SDV.\n4. They take the SDV back to the submarine and re-enter.\n\nAqualink illustrated the 4-step process in the Workflow Diagram below and used it as an MVP prompt to have SEAL divers explain the tasks they performed in greater detail. This is where the real learning began.\n\nWhile the four steps indicated a straightforward task, sharing the Workflow Diagram as an MVP revealed that divers face intense needs when performing steps #2 and #3 - divers rarely swim directly from the SDV to their destination and back. As the team learned, visibility is low underwater (given that they operate at night, it is often impossible to navigate visually) and there isn\u2019t any GPS connectivity. Consequently, divers need to surface to get a GPS location ensuring they are heading in the right direction. Detailed information about diver workflow taught Aqualink that divers spend 20-30 minutes safely surfacing and resubmerging to avoid being lost and getting the bends.

In addition, Aqualink couldn\u2019t help but notice that the diver workflow didn\u2019t include any mention of health besides the bends, and that medics did not make an appearance on the diver workflow! Armed with profound insights from the VPCs, Beneficiary Archetypes, and Workflow Diagram, the team now had enough info to complete the left side of the diver VPC.\n\n![The Beneficiary - Value Proposition Canvas](image)\n\nNow Aqualink understood both diver and medic Beneficiary perspectives.\n\nThis process, and breathing space, forced Aqualink to reconsider how they might deliver value to both SEAL divers and medics. The team realized that the thread linking the diver\u2019s intense needs felt navigating underwater with the medic\u2019s intense needs of providing diver health was the length of time divers spent underwater. Both medics and divers needed to limit the time divers spent underwater, but for different reasons. If, Aqualink reasoned, they could help divers get to their destination quicker, then it would help them achieve the task most valuable to them. Additionally, if the team could add value to medics by causing divers to spend less time underwater, then they would mitigate the risk of adverse health consequences. The team realized that both divers and medics could benefit from an underwater navigation solution.\n\nAqualink took a step back from developing the FitBit for divers the Problem Sponsor requested. Aqualink knew divers would not wear the sensor (several divers told the team this directly) and would be happy with the team\u2019s underwater navigation direction. However, Aqualink was anxious about how their Problem Sponsor, the medics, would feel about the new direction. The team approached their Problem Sponsor with candor and data. The hackers informed the medics that they could build the FitBit but divers would never wear it, citing interview quotes from divers. Aqualink then told them about the underwater navigation problem and showed the medics data on how solving that would help them improve diver health by limiting their time spent underwater. To the team\u2019s surprise, the medics were supportive! Both Beneficiary groups were excited about the direction Aqualink was heading.\n\nDespite the progress, Aqualink still had lots of work to do.

In Step 1, they focused on identifying who they were solving a problem for. In Step 2, Aqualink tested versions of the VPC, Beneficiary Archetype, and a Workflow Diagram to determine what value their Beneficiaries needed and when, where, and why they needed it. Aqualink was only able to begin thinking of how a solution could add value after being able to answer these questions. Had Aqualink simply built the sensor the dive medics initially requested, it would have been a failure lying on the ocean floor because divers would have rejected it.\n\nPer the Einstein quote at the beginning of the chapter, hackers must strive to deliver value, not to strive to achieve success. The goal of this class is not to just build any solution. The goal is to deploy a solution capable of helping End-Users perform their work. Here are some of the most important takeaways from this chapter:\n\n- **Value Propositions (VPs)** are the benefits a solution delivers to End-Users to help them perform a task. VPs are distinct from the solutions themselves. The best VPs solve one or two pain points for a specific End-User.\n- **Beneficiary Value Proposition Canvas (VPC)** is useful for identifying End-User needs (tasks, pains, gains) and match them to VPs.\n- **Beneficiary Archetypes** are used for deeply understanding Beneficiary perspectives and operational contexts, aiding in the precise development of solutions. Effective solution design requires a deep understanding of the distinct needs of all Beneficiaries.\n- **Existing Solutions and Workflow Diagrams Indicate Important VPs.** There is no better indicator of a VP than an End-User saying the existing solution isn\u2019t good enough because [important Value Proposition]. Aqualink learned the workflow divers used to achieve their mission which revealed important VPs the divers needed. It also revealed success metrics: Divers got lost, which added valuable time to the mission. Identifying the existing solutions End-Users use and their shortcomings is the quickest way to determine which VPs are most important. It will also tell you how success and failure is measured. Successful VPs always deliver value that is sufficient and measurably better than the existing solution. Some VPs are novel and present a new offering while others, more commonly, are like existing offerings but refined to better align to End-User needs. The underwater GPS beacon supported the time savings divers sought because it supported them in helping End-Users perform their work.", "page_summary": "This page discusses the importance of understanding beneficiary needs to create effective value propositions, using Aqualink\u2019s underwater GPS beacon as an example.

These tasks serve as building blocks because they accrue into inputs valuable to leaders with decision-making authority at the operational level.\n\nThe operational level involves larger organizational activities like planning, structuring, and maneuvering organizations within a theater of operations for the purpose of conducting campaigns, establishing peacekeeping or humanitarian missions, developing capabilities to form alliances, and coordinating military operations. Operational goals are achieved in the medium term, typically consisting of activities lasting weeks to months. As tactical outputs support operational achievement, operational outputs then support strategic outcomes.\n\nThe strategic level is the top of the government activity hierarchy. It consists of large organizations run by high-ranking leaders. Strategic leaders are responsible for defining missions and selecting and planning campaigns to be carried out at the operational level.

At first, and like many H4D Problem Statements, both Common Ground\u2019s problem and solution appeared simple and straightforward:\n\n- **Develop a communications platform to improve connectivity between U.S. and Republic of Korea (ROK aka South Korea) forces at the United Nations Command Security Battalion.**\n\nA new, improved communications platform would, in theory, mitigate a growing number of communication problems between U.S. and ROK forces.

Notably, the team learned that American and Korean leaders were a touch nostalgic. They wanted to return to the 2009-2012 period when U.S.-ROK relations and communications had been strongest. Leaders measured these years as being successful since there were very few personnel issues, more joint exercises, and high levels of participation in those exercises on both sides. Therefore, leaders were pursuing three MAFs: 1) reducing episodes of personnel issues between the U.S. and South Korea; 2) increasing the number of joint exercises; and 3) increasing the levels of participation in those exercises.\n\nCommon Ground\u2019s communications platform aimed to increase connectivity between the U.S. and ROK personnel but didn\u2019t support any of the MAFs leaders were focused on.

How could communications technologies be the source of the problem when the same technologies were used during the height of U.S.-ROK relations? The problem was not caused by how the communication occurred; it was caused by what was being communicated. This meant that their proposed communication platform would not solve the problem because the U.S.-ROK relationship had been healthy without it. The team realized that their Problem Statement was written from the perspective of the End-User, not the Decision-Maker. As such, the team realized that facilitating more communication could actually hurt relations. The U.S. leaders interviewed seemed to know this intuitively even if they didn\u2019t articulate it.

Moreover, the Korea side of the story helped explain why the U.S. commander faced the issues he did. With these two Decision-Maker perspectives, Common Ground now needed to figure out how to solve the problem.\n\nThe key lesson for hackers? Focusing on Mission Achievement Factors made Common Ground realize that solving their End-Users\u2019 apparent problems did not solve the problems Decision-Makers cared about most. Understanding the Decision-Maker perspective also made the team realize the flaws in their Problem Statement. Following the teachings, rules, and H4D process helped the team refocus on the big picture problem and break it down into manageable, valuable, and readily identifiable pieces. As a result, and the focus of the next chapter, Common Ground developed a solution that appealed to End-Users and Decision-Makers alike.\n\nIt's normal that not every Problem Statement ends with a technical, engineered product as the solution that delivers and aligns Value Propositions. It\u2019s actually rare to build a \u201cthing\u201d as the best answer to the problem, and extremely rare to end up with a company like Capella Space. Nevertheless, solving these problems is extremely important. If hackers are able to do it with a solution as a \u201cPointy-Talky Card,\u201d then that\u2019s a very elegant, cheap, and low-risk solution. It's a bullseye!\n\n## Guiding Principles for Mission Achievement\n\n- **End-Users and Decision-Makers.** It\u2019s very common for hackers to identify a real problem an End-User experiences that isn\u2019t in the top 3-5 things their Decision-Makers care about. Learning about the disconnect is often disheartening for hackers, sometimes excruciatingly so. But if solving the problem isn\u2019t comparatively important enough to the Decision-Maker it will fail. Frequently the constraining factor is the attention span of the Decision-Maker. They simply just don\u2019t have enough time to hear or think about your solution, because it\u2019s not their top problem. Hackers must realize that if their solution doesn\u2019t add value to leaders by helping them achieve the MAFs they care about, then the solution is doomed. This is exactly why H4D starts with the Problem Statement, and proceeds by validating the value End-Users and Decision-Makers need before making a solution. It eliminates this entire failure branch of the decision tree.\n- **Satisfying Decision-Makers is just as, if not more, important than satisfying End-Users.** Again, I can speak from experience. Even as an Airborne Ranger, I could never decide which equipment to use (as is the case with every enterprise software license ever sold). Oftentimes, someone in the leadership made that decision for me and that someone was often a person who would never use the equipment.

Fuel was flown from abroad into the central military base in the capital of Kabul. From there, it would be trucked to regional bases and then delivered by aircraft to remote outposts, called forward operating bases (FOBs).\n\nEach step of the process had its challenges. Trucking the fuel from the central base to regional bases was dangerous as the roads were littered with improvised explosive devices (IEDs - aka roadside bombs) that injured and killed hundreds of people every month. In 2011, more than half of NATO casualties in Afghanistan, and one in three Afghan fatalities, were caused by IEDs.[48] The IEDs impeded road travel and, consequently, the delivery of goods like fuel. Clearing IED-laden roads for supply transportation was critical and a manpower-intensive process with 1,000 people devoted to the task.\n\nSupplying fuel and generator parts to the FOBs also required frequent aircraft trips. Each piece of electrical equipment \u2013 from communications equipment to water pumps \u2013 had its own generator consuming tons of fuel. In addition, using generators to power low-energy equipment led to burnout and a graveyard of broken units at each FOB which meant new generator parts had to constantly be delivered. Maintaining the generators was more than a full-time job. Six of the FOB\u2019s 40 soldiers were devoted full time to keeping generators operational.\n\nCol. Pete Newell, then-Director of the Army\u2019s Rapid Equipping Force (REF), immediately recognized the inefficiency and potential for improvement: the FOBs needed multi-speed and multi-fuel generators which would provide more efficient power while requiring less fuel and maintenance. The solution was simple but delivering generators to FOBs was problematic. Col. Newell needed the Air Commander to agree to deliver the new generators, but the Air Commander\u2019s priority was using his helicopters to perform combat operations, not serve as a generator delivery service. Col. Newell knew how to solve the FOBs\u2019 energy problem, but needed to solve the aircraft delivery problem to execute it. More precisely, he needed to figure out how FOB tactical needs could be aligned with leadership\u2019s operational Mission Achievement Factors.", "page_summary": "This page discusses the logistical and operational challenges of supplying fuel and generators to American forces in Afghanistan, particularly to remote forward operating bases (FOBs).

Newell met a 3-star regional base commander seeking the REF\u2019s help to solve another major issue: Despite spending billions of dollars and deploying thousands of people to clear IEDs, the death toll was still too high in his region. The 3-star\u2019s frustration led to an epiphany for Col. Newell: clearing IEDs and addressing the FOB power supply issue were connected. If he could deliver generators, he\u2019d solve the FOB energy problem *and* there would be significantly less IED clearing required because there would be fewer fuel trucks on the road.\n\nThe 3-star\u2019s pain was so intense he was willing to try anything, especially if it only cost him a helicopter trip to deliver generators. It was an easy decision for him to make. The general told the Air Commander to deliver three generators to a FOB. The lower-ranking Air Commander had no choice but to comply.\n\nThe results were immediate and impactful. The multi-speed generators provided steady power to the FOB, reducing the number of maintenance personnel required from six to one. After one month, the Air Commander was pleased because the more efficient use of fuel meant he could reduce the number of helicopter resupply trips to FOBs by 30 per month, freeing up time to use the aircraft for the combat operations he prioritized. The Air Commander was so pleased that he volunteered to deliver additional generators to other FOBs. Within three months, the fuel consumed by the FOBs in the 3-star general\u2019s region was reduced by 80%. Lower fuel consumption meant fewer trucks on the road helping reduce U.S. military IED casualties from 3,542 in 2011 to 1,744 in 2012.[49] Col. Newell\u2019s solution gained such traction that Congress earmarked an additional $20 million for the Rapid Equipping Force in the 2012 defense budget.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t enough for Col. Newell to have a solution for the FOBs \u2013 he needed to align FOB needs with the things leaders cared about because they made the decisions. Once he identified the needs of the FOBs, the Air Commander, and the 3-star, Col. Newell was able to create a solution that satisfied them all. Col. Newell found Solution-Mission Fit.\n\nThe more hackers learn about solving their Problem Statement, the more they learn that they do not know - and the more questions they have about how to add value to meet End-User and Decision-Maker needs.

This is a keystone question.

The expression relates to the subtle nuances of value a solution delivers. In H4D, End-Users seek Value Propositions that help them perform specific tasks at the tactical level. Decision-Makers seek Mission Achievement Factors that enable them to achieve a specific operational or strategic goal. Outputs from the tactical level accumulate to support the achievement of operational goals. Therefore, End-Users and Decision-Makers have different solution needs. An End-User needs the solution to perform a specific task. The Decision-Maker cares less about the task and more about the outcome produced by the execution of that task. The Value Propositions and the Mission Achievement Factors a solution delivers must satisfy those unique needs to support the attainment of a national policy goal both are working to pursue.\n\nIn terms of perspectives, the Indian parable of the blind men and the elephant bears relevance. Although End-Users and Decision-Makers represent distinct perspectives, they are connected, much like the tail and ear of the elephant, or the distinct perspectives of the FOB, Air Commander, and 3-star in Col. Newell\u2019s story. It is up to the H4D team to determine how to connect End-User and Decision-Maker needs and conceptualize a solution capable of delivering value to both (as seen in the Aqualink and Common Ground examples). A solution capable of doing this is said to have Solution-Mission Fit (SMF).\n\nSolution-Mission Fit is when hackers develop solutions that create value for End-Users at the tactical level (so they use it) which translates into value that leaders appreciate at the operational level (so they authorize its use). In shorthand, Solution-Mission Fit = Value Propositions + Mission Achievement. Hackers will know they have found SMF when both Beneficiaries are grabbing the solution out of the team\u2019s hands by attempting to purchase it, proactively making referrals to others experiencing the problem, and/or volunteering to use and provide feedback on the solution. Evidence that SMF has not been found is when End-Users and/or Decision-Makers aren\u2019t getting value from the solution, the idea isn\u2019t spreading by word of mouth, and/or Beneficiary interviews result in lukewarm feedback about the solution. Finding SMF requires hackers to identify the intense needs afflicting End-Users and Decision-Makers (which hackers accomplished in Steps 2 and 3) and iteration on a solution until it satisfies both Beneficiaries. The following case study is a continuation of the Common Ground story that began in the previous chapter.\n\n## Case Study: Common Ground (Part II) - Pursuing Solution-Mission Fit\nThe communications solution Common Ground envisioned met End-User needs but didn\u2019t support the Mission Achievement Factors leaders cared about. Common Ground interviewed U.S. and ROX leaders to learn which MAFs mattered most to them and why they were important. Part II of the Common Ground case study explains how the team aligned End-User and Decision-Maker needs in a solution that accomplished SMF.\n\n### Identifying Intense End-User and Decision-Maker Needs\nCommon Ground had conducted 54 interviews.

In addition, the team knew that mitigating personnel issues would help the commander achieve the three Mission Achievement Factors he cared about most.[ttt] Common Ground was able to solve communications problems for End-Users and solve personnel issues for the Decision-Maker, which is just what Col. Newell did in solving the generator problem for the FOBs while reducing IED casualties for the general. Third, the team knew they could add value to the \u201cLanguage Barrier\u201d problem.

Rather, interviews testing the syllabus revealed that they only wanted to learn a few words to help them accomplish their jobs better. Other MVP feedback indicated that both U.S. and ROK personnel both wanted to improve interpersonal communications but were only interested in doing so in the workplace. Such feedback gave Common Ground an idea: What if they created a Korean language \u201ccheat sheet\u201d providing U.S. soldiers with a reference to the words they needed to know to perform this job? The team created an MVP to determine if the cheat sheet, referred to as the \u201cPointy-Talky Card,\u201d satisfied End-User needs.\n\nFrom the first interview, it was clear the team was headed in the right direction. End-users were excited about the solution and volunteered to provide feedback. Some End-Users asked the team to email the card, and upon receipt, printed and began using it during their daily interactions with their ROK counterparts.

The team understood how adding value to the soldiers in the TOC would translate into the MAFs the commander cared about. Moreover, the team was knowledgeable enough to explain the MVP and its value succinctly. They showed the commander their MVP and told him, using interview quotes from End-Users and Decision-Makers, how it helped improve rapport and understanding between U.S. and ROK personnel. Most importantly, Common Ground stated that increasing American soldiers\u2019 linguistic and cultural awareness was a key hallmark of the tight U.S.-ROK relationship during 2009-2012 and led to a more capable alliance, the strength of which could be measured by an increase in the number of joint exercises and participation in those exercises benefiting the U.S. Battalion Commander. Pleased by the simple solution that addressed his personal needs, the commander immediately issued the card to 50 End-Users in the TOC.

Marines carry between 90 to 159 pounds of equipment. Soldiers carry between 96 to 140 pounds.[150] An overly burdened warfighter is immobile and, subsequently, ineffective. Once more, the devil is in the details.\n\nBatteries account for roughly 20 pounds of the weight (or roughly 20% of the total load) that warfighters carry. They power everything from radios, GPS, and rifle aiming sights to night-vision goggles and signaling devices. The reason warfighters are burdened is further complicated because they need lots of batteries - nearly each electronic device requires a different type. Warfighters must carry back-up batteries as the power that batteries store is insufficient to last them an entire mission. Given these details, it\u2019s clear to see how reducing battery weight to lighten the warfighter\u2019s load becomes a matter of national security. Anthro Energy - from the class of 2020 - solved this battery problem by creating the world\u2019s first \u201cstructural battery.\u201d\n\nAnthro Energy batteries are lightweight, non-combustible, and flexible. They not only reduce the weight warfighters carry, but also increase the comfort in carrying battery weight, resulting in a more mobile warfighter. Anthro Energy began by solving a problem in the H4D classroom and is now on the path to electrify the world by changing the shape of energy storage. They deliver batteries to American national security organizations and have a thriving commercial business. Anthro Energy has also been recognized by Forbes and MIT Technology Review as being at the forefront of \u201cpowering a more sustainable future.\u201d[151] While Anthro Energy\u2019s successes have been great, their journey was no different from yours: riddled by problems, obstacles, and highs and lows.\n\nThe team-turned-company began Hacking for Defense class without even recognizing the problem they would eventually become world-famous for solving. Anthro Energy\u2019s initial Problem Statement was sponsored by the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Joint Chiefs wanted a better power source for emergency radios to increase the chances of rescuing pilots that crash or eject behind enemy lines. However, conducting 143 class interviews taught Anthro Energy that Air Force special operations personnel, not pilots, were the team\u2019s Beneficiary. Dr. David Mackanic, founder of Anthro Energy, advises H4D teams to cast a wide net and always engage several government organizations. In conversation with your author, Dr. Mackanic noted that \u201ceven if you are solving a problem for your Problem Sponsor, you should still talk to other relevant organizations. Doing so allows students to develop a narrative about the Beneficiary and the importance of the problem they face before focusing on a solution.\u201d He makes a good point: Widespread engagement provides a more diverse perspective on the problem which, in turn, forces teams to generate solutions worth building.

In H4D, Dr. Mackanic reminisced during a conversation with your author, \u201cwe learned that deploying a solution required teams to be as invested in relationships as much as being invested in developing the technology.\u201d In other words, it\u2019s not a bad idea to see creating relationships as an objective in itself.\n\nFostering Buy-In and Support relationships, getting the word out about Anthro Energy\u2019s technology, and gaining endorsements necessary for deploying their batteries, were as important as developing the technology. In H4D, many teams make the mistake of focusing on the ends but not the means - that is, the outcome sought rather than the process required to achieve the outcome. The natural inclination of hackers is to develop the solution and then deploy it. However, pursuing development at this stage is risky because developing a solution capable of delivering Value Propositions and Mission Achievement Factors to Beneficiaries without understanding Buy-In and Support and without crafting a Deployment pathway has a scant chance of success. Anthro Energy serves as a successful example of cultivating Buy-In and Support relationships and understanding Deployment processes within the government to ensure the solution is viable before spending resources to develop the solution.\n\nUpon finishing the H4D class, Anthro Energy developed a battery prototype. Using the tools, skills, and networks established in this class, the company secured a $600,000 grant from the Office of Secretary of Defense\u2019s National Security Innovation Capital (NSIC) program. It only took six months from the time Anthro Energy learned about NSIC to the time they received their first check (which is lightspeed for the government). The response was so quick because Anthro Energy was able to leverage its deep knowledge of the problem, the network of government champions they created during their interviews, and their knowledge about deployment to excite NSIC program managers. \u201cCasting a wide net\u201d to understand a wide breadth of needs also enabled Anthro Energy to pursue opportunities with several government organizations as the company won the Army\u2019s xTechSearch competition and secured funding from In-Q-Tel, the Intelligence Community\u2019s venture capital arm.\n\nThe application, appeal, and impact Anthro Energy can generate is nearly limitless. Anthro Energy has used their H4D experience, and the private funding the class helped them accrue, to accelerate the commercialization of its battery technology. Anthro Energy batteries are now used by the U.S. Army, Air Force, Special Operations Command, and organizations in the Intelligence Community, as well as the commercial medical and wearables sectors. Three years after the course ended, the San Jose-based company leveraged its success with the government to raise a $7.2 million Seed Round to unlock dramatic expansion opportunities. Such success has enabled Anthro Energy to begin scaling across commercial and federal markets to capture an ever-growing slice of the $9 billion-dollar wearable battery market.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn mountaineering, simply getting to the summit is the goal.

The government is no different. One such myth is of the U.S. government spending millions of dollars during the Cold War space race to develop a pen capable of writing in zero gravity, while the Soviets simply used a pencil. The myth is used to highlight American excess, waste, and mismanagement of funding.[52] As with all myths, there is some truth to the story as well as lessons to learn. The true Space Pen story exemplifies how difficult it is to deliver a solution to the government even when it desperately and urgently needs it.\n\nThe story begins in 1965 when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) realized it needed an instrument capable of writing in zero gravity, since standard pens could not. Using pencils was deemed too hazardous for the mission. Pencil lead could easily break off, float away, and have disastrous consequences if inhaled by astronauts or lodged in electronics.[53] Not only did pencils pose a risk, they also created a public outcry after it became known NASA spent $4,382.50 on 34 mechanical pencils.[54] As a result, NASA had to find a writing utensil that was both effective and politically palatable.\n\nAt the time, Fisher Pen Company was already working on a pressurized pen that could write in zero gravity. Fisher had already invested $1 million of its own funds into research and development for what is now commonly referred to as the \u201cSpace Pen\u201d (contrary to popular belief, no funding came from NASA). According to *Scientific American*, the pen can write upside down, in frigid or roasting conditions (down to -50\u00b0F or up to 400\u00b0F), and underwater.[55] Fisher patented the Space Pen and offered to sell it to NASA.\n\nDespite NASA\u2019s intense need and the Space Pen\u2019s ability to satisfy it, Fisher was unable to sell anything to NASA for two years. Ostensibly, the delay was due to NASA\u2019s rigorous and glacial procurement process, which was designed to avoid a repeat of the public backlash over their expensive mechanical pencil acquisition.[56] In truth, Fisher struggled to get their pen into astronaut hands because they failed to hack through the government bureaucracy to gain support from key personnel responsible for procuring products for the government. By 1967, Fisher sold approximately 400 pens to NASA at a cost of $6 per unit and have sold them ever since. While a success (the Space Pen has been on every NASA manned space flight since 1967), the deal should have taken weeks to close, not years.\n\nH4D hackers and entrepreneurs working in companies, like Fisher, often believe that if they solve a real, obvious need then everything else will fall into place. The Space Pen story shows that providing effective solutions is only half the battle.

It takes hard work, charm, diligence, ingenuity, and a whole lot more. The commercial sector is no cakewalk, but the federal sector is even more difficult. Hackers and entrepreneurs must identify and satisfy three people (End-Users, Decision-Makers, and Buyers) to deliver a solution. Commercial customers don\u2019t sit in classified buildings. Moreover, one person doesn\u2019t simply use, decide what to purchase, and spend money on the purchase. In any market, but especially in the government, gaining the Buy-In and Support of those who have control or influence in the acquisition process is crucial.\n\nThe H4D process cracks these difficulties wide open. This step - Buy-In and Support - explains the process with a laser focus on people, specifically the people H4D teams need to identify, engage, and win over to deliver a solution. The chapter first explains key concepts, defines terms, and provides examples. Case studies and tasks are also provided. Each will help hackers determine which people their team needs to find, engage, and interview to get a solution approved for delivery.\n\nAt this point in the process, hackers have generated and validated ideas for delivering Value Propositions and Mission Achievement Factors to Beneficiaries, and tested solution ideas. When learning that they are only halfway to the finish line, hackers usually cry \u201cWhat?! We have to interview more people? We already know who our Beneficiaries are and what they need and how to address it!\u201d Yes, dear hackers, you do; many more.\n\nThe Buy-In and Support step introduces hackers to three new categories of people - Champions, Buyers, and Saboteurs - that must be interviewed and identified to ensure the envisioned solution has the support necessary to be delivered. Hackers must quickly learn who is who to cultivate the requisite support to overcome government antibodies opposed to a new solution! Each category is briefly introduced below and in depth a few pages later. This chapter is designed to help hackers find, create, and build a government \u201cA-Team\u201d of people who will back the team and its solution from start to finish. Such people can offer advice, speed up the process, and help teams avoid common pitfalls. Be warned: Hackers who skip or rush this step will likely face the same problems that blocked the Space Pen, or worse.\n\n## Defining Buy-In and Support\n\nThis chapter introduces hackers to the term Buy-In and Support. It helps hackers answer which people must support the solution for it to be delivered to Beneficiaries. Buy-In and Support refers to the relationships a team must cultivate with people, almost always in the government, to successfully deliver a solution to End-Users.[ttt] These support people are responsible for either procuring solutions or influencing Decision-Makers on what is procured. They can help teams navigate government bureaucracy, regulations, and testing requirements. Buy-In and Support is required for every solution. There are no exceptions. If the people involved in the delivery of a solution are neglected, the solution will never be deployed. Therefore, teams tackle Buy-In and Support to determine if a solution can even be deployed before developing the solution.\n\nThe trick to this step is first finding Solution-Mission Fit. Once a team recognizes how to deliver Value Propositions and Mission Achievement Factors to satisfy End-User and Decision-Maker needs, they must determine if that solution has the potential to satisfy Buyer requirements. It is then important to find Champions who will support a solution and Saboteurs who will attempt to block the solution. Buyers, Champions, and Saboteurs are", "page_summary": "This page discusses the importance of gaining Buy-In and Support from key stakeholders (End-Users, Decision-Makers, Buyers, Champions, and Saboteurs) in the government acquisition process.

Awareness of each category is vital for effective Buy-In and Support. Discerning where Buy-In and Support exists or is lacking will inform which solution a team develops. Below is a basic illustration of these categories and the likelihood of their involvement with a solution based on how it affects them.\n\n### Buyers\nBuyers are people with the purchasing power to acquire your solution. Buyers are essential to hackers deploying their solution. In the H4D world, Buyers are often contracting officers who create agreements between the organization with the solution and the government. For organizational and policy solutions, the Buyer is typically the policymaker or policy recommendation committee responsible for enacting the recommendations. Buyers are not End-Users (because they will not use, or directly benefit from, the solution). Buyers are not Decision-Makers (because the decision to purchase a solution does not lie with them). Buyers are the individuals responsible for executing the deployment process. Figuratively speaking, End-Users, Decision-Makers, and Buyers each represent one leg of a three-legged deployment stool.\n\nBuyers begin their work after a Decision-Maker deems a solution valuable to helping End-Users perform their tasks which contribute to leaders attaining their Mission Achievement Factors. Consequently, Buyers lack the authority to begin a procurement, but have the power to kill a procurement if a solution doesn\u2019t have evidence of its value or does not adhere to the legal constraints Buyers must follow. In some instances, Buyers are unable to procure a solution, no matter how badly End-Users and Decision-Makers need and want it, because of those legal constraints. Consequently, hackers do not design a solution to satisfy Buyer needs, but must ensure that their solution meets the necessary criteria for Buyers to procure it.\n\nBuyers usually perform three primary tasks. First, they determine whether the solution delivers the best value, in the shortest time, and of the highest quality and whether it has the requisite licenses and certifications to be \u201cused\u201d by government personnel. Second, the Buyer ensures the H4D team, or company, is compliant with federal regulation. Third, Buyers establish an agreement between the organization with the solution and the government, administer transactions and financial processes between the two, and record the agreement and transaction in a database. Performing these tasks means that Buyers have a wealth of information hackers can use to guide them to successfully deploy a solution.", "page_summary": "This page introduces the categories of Buyers, Champions, and Saboteurs, emphasizing the importance of identifying and engaging each for effective Buy-In and Support.

Champions are people possessing deep knowledge, experience, and networks within the government. They are so excited by a solution that they work nights and weekends to help hackers by offering advice on which organizations and people to work with, identifying the people necessary to gain support in a deployment pathway, and explaining how to hack through the government\u2019s processes and protocols. Champions are so important to hackers that it is advisable to treat the management of the relationship with Champions as a project objective in and of itself. Successfully managed, Champions generate cost, time, and quality efficiencies in three primary ways:\n\n- **Warm Introductions:** Champions provide warm introductions to End-Users, Decision-Makers, and Buyers who teams never knew existed. In many cases, teams find it easy enough to identify Beneficiaries but often struggle to communicate, engage, or meet with Buyers. A warm, meaningful introduction from a Champion will help teams land the interviews that matter.\n- **Credibility:** Champions generate credibility for the team, the problem they are working on, and their solution. Champions believe in a solution so intensely they leverage their contacts and social capital to endorse it. Champion support makes other government personnel believe in the team\u2019s solution leading to meetings with influential government stakeholders. Such support, confidence, and commitment lead to teams meeting the right stakeholders.\n- **Matchmaking:** Champions help teams match a solution\u2019s value to Beneficiary needs and Buyer constraints. Identifying these sorts of relationship opportunities dramatically shortcuts bureaucratic processes and can fast-track Beneficiary Discovery. In the past, Champions have matched H4D teams with pilot programs. Doing so generated early feedback to improve how hackers delivered VPs to End-Users and MAFs to Decision-Makers. One Champion helped a team establish relationships between End-Users, Decision-Makers, and Buyers so the team could pull together funding and contracts.\n\nFinally, and just like the old medieval world, true Champions are hard to find! As such, and in my experience, they quickly become the biggest, best, and boldest asset to effectively deploy a solution. Some H4D teams get lucky and find these Champions in their immediate Problem Sponsors. However, most teams encounter Champions through conducting interviews, which - once more - is the reason the most successful H4D teams do 10-15 interviews per week.\n\n## Saboteurs\nSaboteurs, as the name suggests, will do everything they can to ensure your solution will not be deployed. Saboteurs don\u2019t act out of malice. They care about the success of their government organization or are a company with a lucrative contract that hackers are displacing. Their objections are rational.", "page_summary": "This page discusses the critical role of Champions in the H4D process, describing how they provide introductions, credibility, and matchmaking to help teams succeed.

As such, company Saboteurs often have a vested interest, or incentive, in maintaining the status quo.\n\nSaboteurs will actively work to prevent a team\u2019s solution from being deployed. As such, they are often the reason existing solutions are not improved upon and government problems endure. Identifying Saboteurs early is as important, if not more, as identifying Buyers and Champions. Done well, teams can avoid them, bypass them, or win them over. Several teams managed Saboteurs so well that they became the team\u2019s first customers.\n\nThe following case study describes how Team Fleetwise encountered and managed Buyers, Champions, and Saboteurs to gain Buy-In and Support for their solution.\n\n## Case Study: Team Fleetwise - Identifying Buyers, Champions, and Saboteurs\n\nTeam Fleetwise was a 2021 Hacking for Defense team composed of four people.

Additionally, the Buyers helped Fleetwise create a timeline of the certifications and Decision-Maker approvals needed as they developed their technology. Contracting officers also shared the steps previous companies took to deploy previously used solutions. This information led Fleetwise to several opportunities and provided the team with the names of companies with similar solutions and Decision-Makers that Fleetwise would interview to learn more about the deployment process.\n\n## Learning from Saboteurs\nAt first, Fleetwise was unsure how to handle the Leidos and Vehicle Support Chain Operations Squadron (VSCOS) Saboteurs, so the team mistakenly avoided them. Bad mistake. While Fleetwise attempted to deliver their software solution to the 4th LRS, VSCOS found out and - because their jobs were, they felt, threatened - did everything in their power to block Fleetwise from delivering the solution. In other words, the more Fleetwise tried to ignore, avoid, or go around VSCOS, the more dangerous the Saboteur became.\n\nEventually, Fleetwise realized they had to stop running and directly engage with VSCOS. This pivot was critical to finding Solution-Mission Fit. It allowed Fleetwise to gain vital, if painful, feedback from VSCOS on their handling of the process, understanding of the problem, and intended solutions. Fleetwise dug deeper into understanding VSCOS and their tasks, pains, and gains. The epiphany came when Fleetwise realized VSCOS was also suffering from servicing and maintaining the readiness of over 100,000 vehicles across 100 Air Force bases and sought to protect their work. Understanding VSCOS\u2019s perspective enabled Fleetwise to align their solution\u2019s value to FM&A controllers with the needs of VSCOS.\n\nOnce Fleetwise was able to show that their work was a complement, not a replacement to VSCOS, over time VSCOS not only stopped blocking Fleetwise but became the team-turned-company\u2019s biggest Buyer. It was then that Fleetwise appreciated that they learned as much from their Saboteurs as they did from their supportive FM&A End-User and Champion, since VSCOS didn\u2019t hold back in providing direct, candid feedback. And, more importantly, the VSCOS Saboteur became Fleetwise\u2019s gateway to larger sales across the Air Force.\n\nOver the course of 114 interviews with people from twenty different Air Force bases, Fleetwise developed Value Propositions and Mission Achievement Factors while validating dozens of MVPs. The team gained Buy-In and Support because they carefully built, reviewed, and maintained relationships with Buyers, Champions, and Saboteurs.\n\nBy the end of class, Fleetwise deployed a beta version of the software tool to maintenance personnel at the 4th Logistics Readiness Squadron at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base. The team\u2019s Champion rushed to tell the team\u2019s story and share its solution across the Air Force. Unbeknownst to Fleetwise, they even nominated the team for the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) award, which the team won at the 15th Air Force Level and the Air Force\u2019s Major Command Level!

To repeat, Buy-In and Support can range from tacit support and outright advocacy to sabotage, blocking, and derailment. In such a complex, massive system, hackers who fail to correctly understand, categorize, and label people\u2019s roles ultimately fail. Teams that cannot identify End-Users, Decision-Makers, Buyers, Champions, and Saboteurs cannot learn valuable insights from them. The ability to identify these stakeholders comes by maintaining organized notes that your team can use, search, and re-use, as well as updating Workflow Diagrams and Influence Maps as interviews are conducted.\n- **Leverage Champions.** Many teams excel at identifying Champions but fail at the most important step: communicating the exact support the team needs from the Champions. Different people in your network have distinct strengths you can leverage. Teams should carefully match their needs with the skills of their Champions. Don\u2019t be intimidated.

Teams need Buyers to deploy their solution. While Buyers are not Beneficiaries, it is important to learn from them which people can influence the process and get your solution into End-User hands. Buyers can also inform teams on which processes to use for delivery. Cultivating relationships with Buyers early is critical to successful deployment.\n- **Proactively engage and learn from Saboteurs.** Saboteurs are those that reject a team\u2019s idea, MVP, prototype, or solution. Like them or loathe them, Saboteurs are vital to Buy-In and Support. Unsuccessful teams accept the feedback and move on. Successful teams dig deeper to understand the Saboteur\u2019s perspective. They can stall, frustrate, or break a team\u2019s solutions, or\u2014handled diplomatically\u2014provide a team with more candid feedback than anyone positively invested in a solution. Try to remember Saboteurs are individuals with a unique set of grievances, needs, fears, goals, and responsibilities. It just so happens that your offering, to them, seems to get in their way.\n- From observing dozens of classes, the best advice is often the simplest: Treat Saboteurs like any other Beneficiary. Deal with them professionally and maturely. It is better to quickly identify them, understand they are also simply trying to do their job, and engage with them at all times. Remember, you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar. Being professional and empathetic allows hackers to understand Saboteurs\u2019 perspectives before they cause problems. Put simply, do not avoid them\u2014for, as the case study above explains, they can block progress, and you might sacrifice the opportunity to learn valuable insights only Saboteurs will provide.

Everything from the modern internet, satellite navigation like GPS and Google Maps to personal computers and robotics. However, the origin of technologies shifted from the U.S. government to commercial companies during the 1980s after industry began outspending the U.S. government on research and development. Companies are now the wellspring of technology, and governments around the world must buy world-leading technologies from them. Companies must deploy their solutions to the government.\n\nIn 2020, I assembled a working group consisting of Stanford University researchers and Army innovation experts to learn how the Army could partner with companies to rapidly acquire commercial technologies. Our hypothesis was simple: If we mapped out all the Army organizations involved with technical innovation and plotted the pathways successful companies had taken through the bureaucracy, then we could determine which Army organizations companies should work with to deploy their solutions. The rationale for the study was sound. The findings were unexpected. The three lessons we learned are instructive to hackers.\n\nFirst, the Army landscape is constantly evolving. By the time we finished mapping Army organizations with innovation in their titles or mandates, the map was obsolete because the people we spoke with at the beginning of the study moved to a different Army organization by the end of the study, which is common in the government. Additionally, new organizations were created and several organizations we mapped no longer existed. Second, the dozens of successful companies we plotted onto the Army map took unique routes to deliver their products to End-Users and did not converge around a handful of Army organizations like we expected. Even companies in the same stage of growth, operating in the same zip code, that had similar technological solutions at the same level of technical maturity used unique pathways. Third, successful companies navigated the Army by using their personal relationships. For instance, if a company found a Champion at a particular Army organization, that person would introduce the company to their colleagues at other Army organizations until the company made a sale. Defining widely applicable deployment pathways consisting of \u201cfirst go to this Army organization and then this one\u201d wasn\u2019t supported. One constant between those successful companies was developing personal relationships and clearly understanding and swiftly exploiting processes and opportunities that put products into soldiers\u2019 hands.\n\nThe relevance of these three lessons to hackers is this: Hackers must create their own deployment pathway. Many hackers believe that success is based on having the \u201cright\u201d Problem Statement, the \u201cbest\u201d Problem Sponsor, or knowing \u201cthe\u201d deployment pathway. However, these research findings, and evidence from H4D case studies, prove otherwise. Problem Statements change. Problem Sponsors only represent one perspective. Successfully delivering solutions hinges on the relationships hackers develop in Buy-In.", "page_summary": "This page discusses the importance of plotting deployment pathways for commercial technologies in the U.S. Army, highlighting lessons learned from a study on how companies successfully deploy solutions. The key findings are that the Army landscape is constantly changing, successful companies use unique and personal pathways, and relationships are crucial for deployment. The main takeaway for hackers is that success depends on building relationships and creating individualized deployment strategies, rather than following a fixed path.", "images_interpretations": []}

A deployment pathway cannot be precomputed. Hackers will be guided to new deployment processes by their Beneficiaries, Buyers, and Champions that will cause them to identify new people they must gain Buy-In and Support from to utilize. New Buy-In and Support people will then introduce new deployment processes to hackers and the cycle repeats. The key for hackers to successfully deliver a solution, as is the case with the entire H4D process, is to adopt a learning mindset to constantly evolve their thinking by keeping an open mind, exploring which people and processes are most likely to support the delivery of a solution, and documenting the lessons learned along the way.\n\nBuy-In and Support focused on the people necessary to support the delivery of a solution to End-Users. Deployment focuses on identifying processes and opportunities hackers use to deliver a solution before they develop it. The central question Step 6: Deployment addresses is \u201cHow do we deliver a solution to End-Users?\u201d The answer is simple: by creating an ideal deployment pathway based on human support for the solution. The chapter answers this question by first defining \u201cDeployment\u201d and introducing terms like \u201csolution readiness\u201d and \u201cTechnology Readiness Levels (TRL).\u201d A case study on Anthro Energy and several tasks are offered to help teams apply the learnings. Following the contents of this chapter will enable hackers to create a deployment pathway that is tailored to their solution, their Beneficiaries, and their Buy-In and Support network.\n\n# Defining Deployment\nDeployment is a common term used by the government. It refers to the movement of troops or equipment to a place or position for use. In the mid-2000s, for example, my Ranger buddies and I were deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, alongside helicopters, armored vehicles, and boatloads (literally) of equipment. In H4D, the term \u201cDeployment\u201d means getting the team\u2019s solution into End-User hands.[\u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020] The deployment pathway is the route, consisting of processes and opportunities, that the solution travels from the H4D classroom to the place it will be used.\n\nMillions of people work across hundreds of government national security organizations. Hundreds of processes and opportunities exist that hackers can use when creating a deployment pathway. The combination of organizations, processes, and opportunities is, therefore, innumerable. If hackers asked five people how to deliver a solution, they would likely get five very different answers. Even relatively small organizations, like the SEAL teams, vary in the way they acquire solutions. One SEAL team might want to purchase their wetsuits directly from a company while another (possibly because of a different mission focus or approval process) acquires wetsuits indirectly through a reseller. In other words, a one-size-fits-all deployment pathway does not exist. Hackers must create their own unique pathway based on the relationships they cultivated in Buy-In and Support and the processes and opportunities they will identify in this chapter.\n\nJust remember that the link between Deployment and Buy-In and Support is inextricable, and this is the reason why this Manual devotes adjoining parts to the topics. Hackers will find themselves oscillating between the people and paths necessary to deploy a solution (Step 5 - Buy-In & Support) and paths necessary to deploy a solution (Step 6 - Deployment).", "page_summary": "This page discusses the iterative nature of delivering solutions, emphasizing the importance of Buy-In and Support networks in creating effective deployment pathways.

To elaborate, each government organization has a TRL range it works with. For example, service research labs, like the Air Force Research Lab, deal in research and mostly engage with low-TRL ideas and prototypes. Program Executive Offices (PEOs), on the other hand, are responsible for acquiring finished solutions and, therefore, engage with high-TRL technologies. Knowing a solution\u2019s readiness will, therefore, help teams narrow down which of the hundreds of national security organizations hackers should work with. Once a team validates that their solution\u2019s readiness aligns with their Beneficiary, they can begin learning which processes the Beneficiary\u2019s organization requires to adopt solutions.\n\nThe goal of deployment is to get a solution from hackers to Beneficiaries. At the outset hackers will have a low-to-zero-TRL solution, for example an idea for a synthetic aperture radar sensor on a satellite useful to the Navy, or predictive maintenance software potentially valuable to the Air Force. Consequently, hackers must first develop a deployment pathway to organizations willing to use an immature solution. Beneficiary feedback, per the *Hypothesize \u2013 Design Experiments \u2013 Test \u2013 Learn* framework, will enable hackers to mature their solution and scale deployment to additional Beneficiaries that work with higher-TRL solutions.

Looking for a better way to power emergency radios used by pilots, the Joint Chiefs submitted their Problem Statement to H4D.

Anthro Energy learned all about the problems pilots would face if they found themselves on the ground, behind enemy lines, needing to be rescued. After learning about pilots\u2019 needs, the team developed a series of MVPs and conducted interviews to evolve their battery solution to satisfy those needs. After sixty-two interviews, Anthro Energy were confident in their intended solution and re-interviewed their pilot Beneficiaries to learn how the team could start deploying prototypes. Pilots told them things like, \u201cWe love your battery, but it needs to be a finished solution for us to use it\u201d and \u201cgive us a call when we can actually use the battery.\u201d Anthro Energy was shocked to learn they couldn\u2019t deploy their battery prototype to the pilot Beneficiaries they had been concentrating on for a month because their solution was too immature. While Anthro Energy were disappointed that the once-enthusiastic pilots represented a dead end, they could rest assured that the pilots would become a Beneficiary once the battery was more mature. They were pleased to learn this sooner rather than later, before wasting time developing a solution directly for pilots that pilots couldn\u2019t acquire. The team was left with two options. First, they could spend two years developing the battery until it was mature enough for pilots to use. Second, Anthro Energy could find a new Beneficiary they could deploy to immediately and then deploy to pilots afterwards. They chose option two and used the TRL table to support them.\n\n### Start Using the TRL Table as a Filter\n\nWhen solving government problems, the first step is to determine who has a problem that needs to be solved. The second step is understanding the Beneficiary\u2019s perspective deeply to know the value they require to address that problem. When determining a deployment pathway, hackers must get more granular to determine who cares about what value _and_ at what stage of the solution\u2019s maturity do they begin to care. Some government organizations are willing to use a duct-tape prototype. Others need the solution to be completely streamlined and polished. To make sense of who could use what, and when, hackers must understand the TRL scale and create a TRL table specific to their solution. This is exactly what Anthro Energy did. They studied the TRL scale and realized that, like nearly all H4D teams, their solution was somewhere between TRL 0 and TRL 1. Anthro Energy created a TRL table specific to their lithium-ion battery solution to identify a new Beneficiary that would use their low-TRL solution. The team outlined four categories that would guide them to identify relevant Beneficiaries and the milestones the battery technology would need to achieve if it was to advance in maturity.", "page_summary": "This page discusses how Anthro Energy developed and executed a deployment pathway for their battery technology, using the TRL (Technology Readiness Level) scale to identify and prioritize Beneficiaries as their product matured.

Anthro Energy went back to Beneficiary Discovery to learn three important things about SOCOM. First, SOCOM was not a single entity. Rather, it is a giant organization composed of several smaller organizations from the Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps.

They carried too many batteries which limited their mobility and hurt their performance. Digging deeper, Anthro learned that one reason contributing to heavy loads was that people from each of these groups carried a range of different batteries (and backups) because a single universal battery to power all electronic devices didn\u2019t exist. Further, SOCOM interviews and MVP tests revealed that the Air Force\u2019s Guardian Angels were particularly burdened by batteries which prevented them from performing their tasks. Anthro Energy had found a new Beneficiary.\n\nDuring thirty-five interviews with Guardian Angels, Anthro Energy heard quotes like, \u201cthe three main things I think about are water, ammunition, and batteries,\u201d and \u201cbattery management is a headache.\u201d The team came to realize that a battery integrated into backpacks or body armor could improve mobility and, therefore, performance.

In fact, if any solution mitigated the pain they experienced, they would try it!\n\nThe Guardian Angels\u2019 unique and critical need was reflected in the Mission Achievement Factors Decision-Makers needed from improved Guardian Angel performance. One Decision-Maker was unequivocal in his response to Anthro Energy\u2019s MVP solution, telling the team, \u201cYou are doing something that is going to save lives.\u201d It was at this point that Anthro Energy realized they had discovered a new End-User and Decision-Maker and found Solution-Mission Fit.

The best process for deploying Anthro Energy\u2019s battery prototype was the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant.\n\nBased on the TRL, Anthro Energy learned about additional Beneficiaries and processes for deploying their solution, such as the National Security Innovation Capital opportunity. The team validated a new Beneficiary and created an actionable deployment path to begin deploying their prototype.\n\n## Anthro Energy Deployment Success\nThrough the H4D process, Anthro Energy learned that their pilot Beneficiary didn\u2019t support an initial deployment and navigated the government using the tools, skills, and networks developed in class to find a suitable Beneficiary.

Anthro Energy identified their solution\u2019s TRL. Doing so enabled them to immediately learn which organizations were relevant to their deployment and which would become relevant as their battery solution matured.\n- **Milestones also help teams effectively engage with Beneficiaries.** In Anthro Energy\u2019s case study, understanding the TRL evolution of batteries also helped Anthro Energy plan which milestones would need to be satisfied at each level. This knowledge helped with project management, allocation of scarce resources, and bringing sharper focus to the team\u2019s Beneficiary interviews.\n- **Different Beneficiaries use different deployment processes.** Effective Deployment involves determining which processes will comprise the deployment pathway. Once a team validates which Beneficiary they can deploy their solution to and the process, the pathway becomes clearer. Deployment pathways consist of multiple organizations and opportunities and can take many different forms and consist of many different steps. Identifying the initial Beneficiary and the process hackers can use to begin working with them is essential. Once you determine the low-TRL solution, finding new Beneficiaries to deploy higher-TRL solutions is easier. Remember, the idea is to define what deployment looks like to you and your team, develop a deployment pathway required to get there, and then go test (and test again!).\n\nSee commonmission.us/h4d-manual for examples of Deployment slides.\n\n## Application and Tasks\n**Task 1: Determine your solution\u2019s TRL [10 mins]**\nReview the TRL table (p. 171) and the government\u2019s Technology Readiness Assessment Guide to categorize the maturity of your intended solutions.\n\n**Task 2: Identify Initial Beneficiaries and deployment processes [45 mins]**\nValidate that your Beneficiary can work with your solution\u2019s existing readiness level. Categorize the Beneficiary organizations which you have engaged by TRL.

No matter how unique your problem is, and no matter how specialized your solution is, something similar has already been deployed to the government. The same Value Propositions may have already been deployed via, for example, an analog solution. Or an unrelated solution might have already been delivered to the exact same Beneficiary you are targeting. Finding and tapping into existing deployment processes are the best place to begin creating a deployment pathway. Which organizations, by TRL, acquire similar solutions? Which processes do they use to acquire them? Studying those who came before you, what they tried, what worked, what didn\u2019t, is one of the cheapest, fastest ways to get smarter. The dumbest thing you can do is blindly repeat the expensive mistakes someone else already paid for in dollars and hours of their life.\n\nStart by doing some research that answers the following questions:\n\n1. Which solutions have been deployed to your Beneficiary? (Specify product/service or software/hardware based on your intended solution. If the search doesn\u2019t yield results, consider broadening.)\n2. What similar solution has previously been deployed to the Defense Department or Intelligence Community? Identify general solutions your Beneficiary is currently using and then detail the deployment pathway that solution took to reach the Beneficiary [45 mins].\n\nAnswer these questions by searching acquisitions on databases such as USASpending.gov, GovSpend.com, and GovTribe.com. These databases consist of all the contracts the government has issued and tendered. Conducting keyword searches on your Beneficiary or Mission Achievement organizations or your Value Propositions will turn up existing/previous contracts. These contracts will indicate which organizations have acquired products/services that may relate to your intended solution. The acquiring organization could be a potential Beneficiary. Good, recent products can also indicate the Value Propositions these organizations care/cared about. Perhaps most importantly, search results usually indicate which companies were awarded which contract. Interviewing these companies and the defense organizations they worked with should inform your team about the good processes and Buyers to target, talk to, and work with. Effective research is an expedient way to identify pre-existing deployment pathways.\n\nIf you struggle to finish any of these tasks, consult with your teaching team and set up interviews with people who can answer the questions you have.

Training is what Silicon Valley-based company, Learn to Win (L2W), excels at. L2W began when a University of North Carolina basketball player and his roommate created an online training platform to help basketball players learn the team\u2019s plays. After this initial success with the Tar Heels basketball team, the duo created the Learn to Win company with the mission of helping college sports teams train athletes more quickly and efficiently through smartphone-accessible micro-video content.\n\nL2W would grow to become the single largest athlete training platform used by collegiate athletes and professional leagues like the NBA, NFL, PGA, NHL, and MLB. L2W\u2019s outsized commercial success rests on its success with the Defense Department.\n\nAnd, guess what? L2W began their meteoric rise in the 2019 H4D class.\n\nThe two company founders sought to import, apply, and leverage their knowledge of training athletes to train uniformed personnel. Two soon became four, and the new team started working on a problem sponsored by the U.S. Air Force\u2019s Air Combat Command. The challenge? To improve and accelerate training to increase pilot trainee retention. Given the Air Force\u2019s motto of \u201cAim High ... Fly-Fight-Win\u201d, as well as a need for pilots to live up to that motto, solving the problem became a task of vital importance.\n\nAs L2W initially learned, the pilot training process had not changed in forty years. Pilot trainees and instructors hated the process because it was antiquated and ineffective. Learning, for example, consisted of studying thousands of printed pages or using 1990s-era computers. If they wanted to study, trainees had to have those printed pages with them or drive to a computer lab in a forgotten corner of an Air Force base. Neither was convenient. Instead of studying frequently for a few shorter periods they studied in long, intensive sessions which hampered their ability to retain knowledge. Moreover, course materials were regularly altered and updated as mechanical and engineering changes were made to aircraft. These changes forced trainees to constantly reshuffle their printed pages with updates leading to confusion about which material was relevant. Oftentimes trainees were unaware of changes because instructors were either unaware of the changes themselves or were unable to incorporate those changes into the course curriculum.\n\nInstructors felt the same. They also hated the antiquated training process because they had to constantly print updated materials and incorporate them into their lesson plans. In addition, instructors used paper and pen to track student progress and scores, which was time-consuming. Trainee issues of retaining core knowledge also meant that instructors had to constantly rehash old lessons. These limitations were costly as pilot training", "page_summary": "This page introduces Part 4: Developing Solutions, focusing on the story of Learn to Win (L2W), a company that revolutionized training for athletes and later applied its expertise to military training.

L2W did not rush to apply its commercial platform because the team did not know if it was yet the right fit for the pilot training problem. During the interviews, the team realized - obviously - that instructors and pilot trainees needed to become more successful. L2W also learned that some computer-based solutions had been tried as desktop computer training was available at some Air Force bases. However, these facilities weren\u2019t used because it required trainees to travel to the computer lab on base, which was inconvenient to trainees. Remote learning was not an option for trainees, but the existence of computer-based training facilities suggested that a digital platform might be viable. The H4D process helped L2W understand what co-founder Andrew Powell called the \u201cnitty gritty of what people needed.

Instructors could also use the prototype to incorporate updates into the curriculum within minutes and create new lessons in a matter of minutes.\n\nA few months after the class concluded, the Air Force awarded L2W $750,000 to create a new computerized training platform for Air Force fighter pilots. L2W now trains over 20,000 military professionals in over twenty Defense Department organizations with training ranging from training pilots, tracking weather, identifying ship corrosion, to identifying medical problems. L2W was the first H4D team in the country to generate recurring revenue with the Defense Department. Success with the government enabled the team to raise $35 million in private investment which was used to build out their commercial and defense training platforms. The defense market accounts for roughly half of L2W\u2019s $7 million annual revenue and the company is growing 2.5 times year-over-year.\n\nSome reading this case study might think, \u201cWell, it\u2019s easy for companies to sell to defense.\u201d This sort of rhetoric could not be further from the truth.

It always, and only, comes at full price. Success in H4D is the same. It requires hard work, late nights, and lots of trial and error. There are no shortcuts. There are, however, several ways hackers can work smarter, not harder, to maximize results while minimizing effort. The key to working smart lies in another key term: prioritization.\n\n## Prioritizing like President Dwight D. Eisenhower\n\nDwight D. Eisenhower, the 34th President of the United States and a five-star general during World War II, knew a bit about action and getting things done. As President, Eisenhower brought Alaska and Hawaii into the union, sponsored and signed the Civil Rights Bill of 1957, led the development of the Interstate Highway System, established NASA, ended the Korean War, and balanced the budget (*three times*). The key to Eisenhower\u2019s success was his ability to prioritize tasks. During a 1954 speech, Eisenhower explained that his prioritization method boiled down to two criteria: \u201curgent and important.\u201d The method remains valuable today. Dr. Stephen Covey, author of the famous book *The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People*, took Eisenhower\u2019s words and used them to develop the Importance-Urgency Matrix.\n\nAccording to Covey, the Importance-Urgency Matrix helped Eisenhower determine critical tasks by organizing them into four categories:\n\n- **High Importance, High Urgency** - critical tasks with strict deadlines. Eisenhower focused his immediate attention and energy on these important and time-sensitive tasks.\n- **Low Importance, High Urgency** - tasks that must be completed in a timely fashion that are not critical. These tasks were not sufficiently critical for Eisenhower himself to perform so he delegated them.\n- **High Importance, Low Urgency** - large payoffs tasks lacking urgency to make executing them essential. Eisenhower \u201csnoozed\u201d these tasks until they matured into another quadrant.\n- **Low Importance, Low Urgency** - nonessential tasks that have little to no payoff and serve as distractions. Eisenhower \u201cdeleted\u201d these tasks.", "page_summary": "This page introduces the concept of planning key activities, emphasizing the importance of prioritization for success. It highlights President Dwight D. Eisenhower's approach to prioritizing tasks using the Importance-Urgency Matrix, which categorizes tasks into four types based on their urgency and importance.

The matrix is divided into four quadrants: (1) High Importance, High Urgency; (2) Low Importance, High Urgency; (3) High Importance, Low Urgency; and (4) Low Importance, Low Urgency. Each quadrant represents a category of tasks. The logical flow is that tasks are evaluated and placed into one of these quadrants based on their urgency and importance. This categorization helps users decide which tasks to prioritize, delegate, delay, or eliminate, providing a clear workflow for managing activities efficiently."}]}
{"page_number": 143, "screenshot_filename": "page_0143.png", "instructions_model_received": "Extract book content and interpret images based the provided schema.", "page_context": "Organizing tasks into these four categories helped Eisenhower juggle a seemingly never-ending to-do list that came across his Oval Office desk. The matrix is relevant to hackers because H4D does not revolve around a couple of assignments like midterms or papers. Rather, effective hacking demands the consistent management of dozens of smaller tasks each week. As you have learned, these tasks vary from sending out interview requests, developing MVPs, synthesizing notes and updating the MMC, crafting slides for class, and so on.\n\nIn fact, there are limitless activities an H4D team can perform. Step 7 of the H4D process teaches teams to define which Key Activities matter most to their Problem Statement and develop a solution. Like Eisenhower, hackers must prioritize the most critical tasks. The following chapter explains how to identify, define, and prioritize \u201ccritical\u201d activities that are imperative to success. Key Activities ensure teams focus on impact and delivery of a solution to Beneficiaries. Effectively undertaking this step helps build good plans of action and can also indicate gaps that need to be addressed. Knowing which Key Activities are critical, as well as the priority attached to them, saves hackers time, effort, and resources. Hackers taking time to plan their Key Activities is further supported by Eisenhower\u2019s quip that \u201cfailing to plan is planning to fail.\u201d\n\nDefining Key Activities\n\nThe term \u201cKey Activities\u201d describes tasks that are highly important and highly urgent, and that hackers must perform to be successful. If a team does not perform Key Activities, their solution will fail. Key Activities vary from Problem Statement to Problem Statement and solution to solution. As an example, a Key Activity for Anthro Energy was to learn the military\u2019s battery specifications. This knowledge would ensure that the battery could be deployed to Beneficiaries at each stage of development. In L2W\u2019s case, Key Activities were identifying which aircraft training curriculum to focus on and collecting training content for specific aircraft. Without prioritizing these Key Activities, L2W would not have been able to complete a working prototype useful to their Beneficiaries. Notice how each activity was critical to each team\u2019s success. Establishing Key Activities requires teams to list activities, prioritize, and narrowly define them in a way that is specific to the team\u2019s unique set of Beneficiaries, Value Propositions, Mission Achievement Factors, Champions, and Deployment pathways. Ultimately, Key Activities constitute the day-to-day priorities teams must follow to develop and deliver their solution.\n\nHaving taught the class for many years, I can say that teams often make two mistakes when trying to figure out Key Activities. First, many list general and vague Key Activities that could be applied to any team regardless of their Problem Statement or the type of solution they are developing; items like conducting interviews and experiments or certifying a solution. The result is like a supervisor telling a subordinate to \u201cget to work\u201d which lacks the guidance required to produce a successful outcome.\n\nThough the team had an End-User that was desperate for a solution, had validated Solution-Mission Fit, and identified a solid deployment pathway, the team couldn\u2019t organize themselves to develop the solution. Nearly a year after they finished the H4D course, they gave up without even producing a prototype. Why? They didn\u2019t know which Key Activities to execute because their list was overly vague and unactionable. For example, \u201cconduct", "page_summary": "This page discusses the importance of defining and prioritizing Key Activities in the H4D process. It explains that effective management of critical tasks is essential for success, drawing parallels to Eisenhower's approach to task management. The text emphasizes that Key Activities must be specific, actionable, and tailored to the team's unique context. Common mistakes include listing vague or generic activities. Real-world examples illustrate how identifying and focusing on the right Key Activities can determine a team's success or failure.", "images_interpretations": []}
{"page_number": 144, "screenshot_filename": "page_0144.png", "instructions_model_received": "Extract book content and interpret images based the provided schema.", "page_context": "interviews\u201d is vague and not actionable, whereas \u201cTom and Erin to interview 5 intelligence analysts by Friday\u201d is specific and actionable. Therefore, useful Key Activities are specific, actionable, owned, and due by a date, with a tangible outcome. Conversely, including too few Key Activities will result in your team missing a critical task and failing to develop and deliver their Value Propositions at all. A to-do list should be structured around an action verb and object. Then attach an owner and a due date, and stack rank by importance.\n\nThe second problem H4D teams experience with Key Activities is one of timing. H4D teams frequently confuse the order in which they need to execute their Key Activities. Some obsess about raising funding, incorporating into a business, or hiring a sales team even before finding Solution-Mission Fit. While gaining investment, solidifying the business, and building out the company are important activities, performing these activities before the team understands the problem is like putting your shoes on before your socks. There is a sequence of Key Activities which reflects the \u201curgency\u201d captured in the Importance-Urgency Matrix.\n\nDetailed Key Activities provide clarity, strategic direction, and a system to measure and evaluate progress (or not) - the \u201cnitty gritty\u201d Powell spoke of from Learn to Win. Detail helps solutions move forward in a systematic way while, at the same time, gauging your progress. In H4D, as hackers soon learn from experience, good strategy and progress are invaluable when solving defense problems. At the very least, make sure to develop a list of Key Activities that are specific to a solution. Prioritizing Key Activities ensures that teams are well aware of the order in which tasks should be completed. For Hemingway, and in the context of H4D, Key Activities ensure hackers \u201cnever confuse executing activities with progress.\u201d\n\n## Key Activities based on Solution Type\nWhile each team\u2019s Key Activities are tailored to its own unique needs, there are several Key Activities that generally relate to three solution types: hardware, software, and knowledge solutions.\n\n### Common Key Activities for Hardware Solutions\nHardware solutions tend to rely on Key Activities relating to the design, development, and manufacture of a physical solution. Specific examples of Key Activities for hardware solutions might involve accessing parts for a prototype and determining the military specifications of a solution, the physical dimensions, and the materials to be used/avoided. Developing hardware solutions almost always involves underlying, supportive, necessary activities like resource procurement (supply chain) and product delivery (distribution), as well as recruitment, research, and selling and marketing.\n\nTeam Aqualink, Capella Space, and Anthro Energy provide good examples. In Aqualink\u2019s early stages, developing an MVP of the GPS buoy simply required slapping an over-the-counter GPS onto an over-the-counter waterproof case and tying a string to it. As Aqualink refined their solution, Key Activities such as 3D-printed parts, precision soldering, or specialized assembly methods became more important to the team\u2019s success. Capella Space was primarily concerned with integrating their Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors with low Earth orbit cube satellites, and where Anthro Energy\u2019s battery was concerned, the team identified several Key Activities and captured them in the MMC below.", "page_summary": "This page discusses the importance of defining, sequencing, and prioritizing Key Activities for H4D teams, emphasizing that activities should be specific, actionable, and assigned with deadlines.

Key Activities for software solutions might consist of integrating platforms and databases, gaining certifications necessary to operate on government systems, and cultivating the human support needed to make certification possible.\n\nTeams Fleetwise and Learn to Win generated software solutions. Key Activities for Team Fleetwise included accessing, collecting, and aggregating data streams from several specific maintenance platforms which required the team to not only learn the data offered on each platform but who the human gatekeepers were to the data so they could develop their real-time vehicle readiness platform. Similarly, Learn to Win\u2019s online learning platform involved Key Activities like accessing pilot course content, determining which content to feature (and how), and planning the display for course content as seen below.\n\n## Common Key Activities for Knowledge Solutions\n\nKnowledge solutions, as the name indicates, are knowledge intensive. Teams creating knowledge solutions capture knowledge and use it to diagnose problems and propose policy recommendations, organizational reconfigurations, and other qualitative recommendations. Where hardware and software solutions develop an understanding of people in order to create a solution, knowledge solutions consist of presenting the insights learned to evidence that a problem exists which serves as the foundation for the recommendations the team makes. Knowledge solutions are common in think tanks, consulting firms, and hospitals.\n\nIf you recall, Common Ground wanted to streamline connectivity between South Korean and American forces. The \u201cPointy-Talky card\u201d they produced was less a product and more a conduit to enhance understanding, information, and knowledge. Common Ground\u2019s Key Activities focused on presenting the relationship and touchpoints between Korean and American servicemen to demonstrate the need for their knowledge solution.

Find meaning in knowing that hard work will generate a valued solution.\n\n### Case Study: Team Gutenberg - Specifying and Prioritizing Key Activities\nThe Office of Defense National Intelligence (ODNI) came to H4D with a major problem. While there was an abundance of unclassified data and training models for parsing unclassified data, those models were unable to generalize tasks specific to classified data. To tackle this problem, ODNI worked with an all-star, 5-person H4D team called Team Gutenberg. The superstar team was composed of three world-class computer scientists (each would go on to work at Apple, Google, and Microsoft), a former venture capitalist, and an Intelligence Community veteran.\n\nWithin just the first week of class, Team Gutenberg learned that ODNI and the broader Intelligence Community had an equal number of problems _and_ opportunities involving machine learning. Interviewees made grand, expansive requests of the team; some wanted a machine learning-powered chatbot while others wanted to leverage machine learning so they did not have to spend endless hours in the depressing, windowless classified offices. Others still wanted to raise awareness about the difference between artificial intelligence and machine learning, while teaching government personnel the difference between science fiction and science fact. To put it simply, the problem space was immense. There was more work than Team Gutenberg could do in 10,000 months, let alone three.\n\nOver the first three weeks of class, Team Gutenberg narrowed their focus. They decided to concentrate on how machine learning could reduce the number of hours intelligence analysts spent performing manual tasks that could be easily automated. The team learned their Problem Statement and Beneficiaries intimately and found Solution-Mission Fit. Yet despite achieving these milestones, their progress stagnated. Each week the team became increasingly frustrated by their lack of progress. The instructors were perplexed how such an exceptional, hard-working, and smart team could be anything but successful. The issue the team had related to Key Activities.\n\n#### Specify Critical Key Activities\nOnce the team learned their problem and validated their MVPs, they struggled to make progress.

Execution leads to progress. Progress leads to impact and success. It should come as no surprise that Key Activities lie at the heart of every success and failure. Failure, remember, occurs when either the wrong activities are performed, or the right activities are not performed (or both). Success occurs only when the right activities are performed. Therefore, while the Gutenberg case study addresses Key Activities for a software solution, the tasks of specifying and prioritizing Key Activities are relevant to all solution types.\n\nThis example shows how a team went from struggling to making rapid progress, but only after specifying and prioritizing their Key Activities. This set the team up for success following the class. The irony of the story is that Gutenberg felt pressure to perform several activities simultaneously. It was only after the team specified their activities and prioritized them into Key Activities that they recognized a small amount of tasks that needed to be performed and were able to make progress. In addition, identifying Key Activities helped them realize the actual problem to be solved: unclassified and unanalyzed data sources caused intelligence analysts to perform data labeling. Finally, I am proud to report that mastering Key Activities helped Team Gutenberg evolve into Vannevar Labs, one of the most successful defense technology startups servicing the government today.\n\n## Guiding Principles for Key Activities\n\n- **Identify Key Activities:** Start broadly by identifying all possible activities. Identifying Key Activities forces hackers to ask, and answer, awkward deeper questions about how their team plans to understand the Problem Statement and develop an impactful solution. Next, narrow down those activities by making them specific and actionable. Lastly, prioritize using the Importance-Urgency Matrix.\n- **Specify Key Activities:** not only do hackers need to determine which Key Activities are critical, they also need to clearly and specifically define them to ensure activities are actionable. For instance, instead of a team listing \u201cdevelop an algorithm\u201d or \u201cbuild a GPS buoy/battery\u201d as Key Activities, break each one into actionable tasks such as \u201caccess data,\u201d \u201cwrite a script for parsing data from database A and database B,\u201d or \u201cdesign a watertight housing for the GPS.\u201d Take your time and remember that lists of vague or general Key Activities are useless. However, done well, specific and actionable lists of Key Activities propel teams forward, mark progress, and save massive amounts of time, energy, and money.\n- **Prioritize Key Activities:** Having too many Key Activities in the MMC suggests a lack of focus. Not all Key Activities are equally important. Beware, failure to prioritize tasks generates inefficiencies and may result in hackers taking on an impossible amount of work. Just as a good hacker wouldn\u2019t put their shoes on before their socks, it makes sense to execute certain Key Activities before others. Hackers should use the Importance-Urgency Matrix to focus on those activities that are both important and urgent, or Key Activities.\n\nSee commonmission.us/h4d-manual for examples of Key Activities slides.", "page_summary": "This page discusses the importance of identifying, specifying, and prioritizing Key Activities for successful project execution.

At this stage, list *everything*. Don\u2019t hold back. The list will be long. Being by asking yourself the following questions:\n\n- **Which activities are important to develop and maintain relationships with Beneficiaries?** These might include specific activities such as reading your Beneficiary organization\u2019s mission statement, developing an Influence Map and Workflow Diagram, or determining which contracting officer serves your Buyer.\n- **Which activities are fundamental to Mission Achievement?** (That is, what do you need to do to ensure that the solution you develop and deploy supports the mission?)\n- **Which activities are important to maintain Buy-In & Support relationships?**\n- **Who has deployed similar solutions to your Beneficiaries? Which Key Activities were most critical to their solution\u2019s success/failure?** (Hint: Reread your Deployment interview notes for indications of Key Activities, and their priority, from companies that have deployed solutions to the Defense Department.)\n\nMake sure to consider the Key Activities based on the type of solution you are developing. Ask yourselves, \u201cis our solution best categorized as a hardware, software, or knowledge-based solution?\u201d Bear in mind that it may be a hybrid or combination of these, or you may still be considering a couple of solution ideas. When brainstorming, use a whiteboard and sticky notes where possible to facilitate idea creation. Be mindful that some of the activities you list might fall under specific categories like research/design, making/manufacturing, and/or selling/marketing.\n\n### Task 2: Specify the Key Activities you Identified [15 mins]\n\nNow that you have a list of all possible Key Activities your team could perform, it is time to make sure those activities are actionable.\n\nCreate a sticky note for each activity on your list. Go through your list, searching for those activities that are vague or unactionable. Spend time specifying those activities by breaking them into smaller, more detailed parts and/or rewording them. Strive for clarity, enough that someone unfamiliar with your project could understand the activity.

For instance, hiring a lawyer or raising funding is important, but it is not urgent while you are still attempting to find Solution-Mission Fit. Snooze these activities until they become more urgent.\n- **Low Importance, Low Urgency:** activities which are distracting and nonessential. They have little to no value and should be discarded.\n\nLastly, and importantly, update your MMC with the activities that are most urgent and important.", "page_summary": "This page explains how to use an Importance-Urgency matrix to prioritize key activities for a team.

The goals were to punish Tsar Alexander I for defying Napoleon\u2019s blockade against Britain and to demonstrate France\u2019s might. Napoleon believed the campaign would result in swift and decisive victory. Instead, it was one of the most devastating military endeavors in history.\n\nThe French army advanced rapidly into Russia. Napoleon was aware of the importance of resources, stating their importance in his famous quote that \"An army travels on its stomach.\" Yet despite his understanding of logistics and the importance of resources, the further they went, the more their supply lines stretched thin.\n\nThe Russians fought hard, but the logistical challenges, such as the vast distances, poor roads, and harsh weather conditions killed more soldiers than battle. Resupply was nearly impossible, exacerbating the effects of the unexpectedly harsh Russian winter. The absence of adequate shelter and supplies weakened the army\u2019s effectiveness on the battlefield. Food shortages began as the Russians burned their own land, leaving nothing for foraging, denying the French the supplies they so desperately needed. Napoleon\u2019s meager provisions were raided by Cossacks using guerrilla tactics. The raids broke the supply lines, created transportation problems, and inhibited Napoleon from sustaining his army. Provisions dwindled. Men grew hungry and ate their horses. Starvation and disease spread. Men deserted. Napoleon\u2019s army struggled to maintain their strength.\n\nOnly 100,000 of Napoleon\u2019s men made it to Moscow where the city was empty, burning, and devoid of resources. There was no victory. His once grand vision of conquest disintegrated as his men succumbed to the relentless Russian landscape and the logistical nightmare it imposed. The French retreat began soon after its arrival. Napoleon returned to Europe defeated with only 40,000 men.\n\nNapoleon\u2019s invasion failed principally due to logistics and the lack of resources. The failure serves as a poignant lesson in military history, highlighting the critical importance of logistics in warfare and the substantial impact it can have on the outcome of a campaign. The failure also serves as a warning to hackers: Key Resources are the lifeblood of the H4D process. Without resources, H4D teams cannot perform the activities required to deliver impactful solutions to their Beneficiaries.\n\nThis chapter is designed to help H4D teams avoid disaster and answer an important question: \"What resources do we need to learn about our problem and develop and deploy our solution?\" Most hackers usually answer \"money!\"", "page_summary": "This page introduces Step 8: Pinpoint Key Resources, using Napoleon\u2019s failed invasion of Russia as a case study to illustrate the critical importance of logistics and resources in achieving success.

{"page_number": 153, "screenshot_filename": "page_0153.png", "instructions_model_received": "Extract book content and interpret images based the provided schema.", "page_context": "## Defining Key Resources\n\nResources are necessary for every individual and organization to succeed. At a base, Maslowian level, individuals require food, water, and shelter to survive. Companies need labor, equipment, and a physical or virtual location to conduct business. National security organizations need materiel, facilities, and personnel to achieve their goals. For example, if the Navy conducts a humanitarian medical mission across the Pacific, Key Resources might include hospital ships, food and medical supplies, and specialized medical personnel. If the Army wages conventional warfare in, say, the Hindu Kush, it needs Key Resources such as cold-weather gear, beans, bullets, bandages, intelligence, and tens of thousands of combat-ready personnel. Key Resources are essential but vary significantly depending on the type of mission being undertaken.\n\nIn the context of H4D, resources are the fuel hackers need to power the execution of Key Activities and make informed decisions. Key Resources are required to develop and deliver any solution. The term Key Resources refers to the assets required to develop and deliver a solution. These can be tangible, like raw materials or equipment, or intangible, like knowledge or skilled labor. In the context of H4D, resources matter because they power Key Activities, turn strategy into reality, and help your team make informed decisions that lead to optimal outcomes. Their strategic importance cannot be overstated; they are how hackers progress from Step 1 all the way to Step 10.\n\nKey Resources are so vital to national security organizations that an entire field is built around them: logistics, or the procurement, maintenance, and transport of resources. The greatest military minds in history stress the importance of logistics. The Chinese general and strategist, Sun Tzu, for example, believed that ready access to resources was the \u201cline between disorder and order.\u201d In the defense world, perhaps the most famous national security quote on the topic belongs to World War II U.S. Gen. Omar Bradley, who observed that \u201camateurs talk strategy, professionals talk logistics.\u201d Regardless of the author, war, or era, the message endures: Key Resources are the lifeblood of a military and, as you will soon realize, successful hacking projects.\n\nTake note, however: Hackers require different resources depending on the Problem Statement and the team\u2019s solution, and at different stages of the process. For example, Team Aqualink initially needed physical resources to develop a prototype and a dive site to test underwater prototype performance as they sought to solve underwater navigation problems faced by SEAL divers. More specifically, the resources Team Aqualink required to undertake two Key Activities (develop a GPS buoy prototype and test it) were relatively simple: a diver\u2019s watch, an over-the-counter GPS, an over-the-counter waterproof case, and a swimming pool. To move beyond the prototype, the team\u2019s needs evolved to include an electrical engineer to customize the buoy to meet SEAL Team needs, funding to pay the engineer, and knowledge of health and safety procedures.\n\n### Categories of Key Resources\n\nIn H4D, there are five categories of Key Resources: human, tangible, intangible, intellectual, and financial. Each is explained below and followed", "page_summary": "This page discusses the importance of Key Resources in both general organizational and H4D (Hacking for Defense) contexts. It explains that resources are essential for achieving goals, powering key activities, and making informed decisions.

It also introduces the five categories of Key Resources: human, tangible, intangible, intellectual, and financial.", "images_interpretations": []}
{"page_number": 154, "screenshot_filename": "page_0154.png", "instructions_model_received": "Extract book content and interpret images based the provided schema.", "page_context": "**Human Resources**\n\nHuman Resources refer to specific skills people employ to get the job done. In national security organizations, no resource is more important than the expertise, skills, knowledge, connections, and influence people possess. The same is true in H4D. Teams must have sufficient human resources to perform Key Activities, or the ability to access human resources outside of the team.\n\nHardware, software, and knowledge solutions, for example, require different types of subject-matter expertise and specialized skills from conducting scientific research to working with End Users to conducting business development. While all solutions require personnel, knowledge solutions require them the most. Knowledge solutions \u2013 like Wohlstetter and his RAND Corporation team\u2019s recommendations to the U.S. Air Force on how to unlock a deep strike capability in the USSR \u2013 rely on experts to collect, analyze, and collate data to create policy recommendations, organizational reconfigurations, and other qualitative recommendations.\n\nRemember Team Common Ground from Step 3: Mission Achievement, the team that designed and delivered \u201cpointy-talky cards\u201d to improve communication between American and Korean forces? There was one major issue with this project, a major skills deficiency: None of the Americans on the team spoke a word of the Korean language! Therefore, the key subject-matter expertise they urgently needed was a bilingual staff member fluent in both Korean and English who could translate messages featured on the card. In short, the team could not have developed their solution without this expertise. Team Anthro Energy needed someone on the team who could build a battery. All teams require human resources unique to their Problem Statement and solution.\n\n**Tangible Resources**\n\nTangible resources, as the name suggests, are things you can see, touch, and feel. These are the equipment, raw materials, and facilities teams require to develop and deliver a solution. Team Aqualink, for example, needed tangible resources like a GPS transmitter and raw materials to create a waterproof casing to make the MVP and, eventually, the prototype of its GPS buoy. Developing and deploying these types of hardware solutions typically requires raw materials, manufacturing equipment, and access to physical military capabilities like boats, tanks, and planes. As a software solution, Learn to Win\u2019s online training platform required computers to develop the software, access to physical training manuals, and access to aircraft to take pictures of the equipment they were training pilots to use.\n\n**Intangible Resources**\n\nIntangible resources are non-physical things like websites, access to and relationships with government personnel, data, and reputation/credibility. They are particularly relevant to software solutions. Team Fleetwise, if you remember, endeavored to solve chronic vehicle maintenance issues faced by the Air Force. To understand the problem, the team needed access to existing maintenance data. This access was crucial for enhancing their comprehension of how Air Force personnel utilize and interact with data in their daily tasks. Fleetwise also needed to create and deploy an online display platform. This meant creating a new, intangible resource, a series of user interfaces capable of testing how Air Force personnel interacted with the data.", "page_summary": "This page discusses three types of resources essential for problem-solving teams: human resources (skills and expertise), tangible resources (physical items and equipment), and intangible resources (non-physical assets like data and relationships). It provides examples of each from real project teams, highlighting the importance of matching resources to the team's specific needs.", "images_interpretations": []}
{"page_number": 155, "screenshot_filename": "page_0155.png", "instructions_model_received": "Extract book content and interpret images based the provided schema.", "page_context": "## Intellectual Resources\nIntellectual Resources encompass the tangible outputs and value derived from applying the expertise and skills of individuals within a team (or external partners). Examples of intellectual resources include patents, copyrights, and other forms of intellectual property such as trademarks, trade secrets, processes, source code, and access to proprietary information. They are a team\u2019s secret sauce and can generate enormous value. Intellectual resources differ from human resources in that intellectual resources are owned. To illustrate the difference, Anthro Energy had a Chemistry PhD on the team who had battery development expertise. This was a human resource. However, this person created a lithium-ion battery patent which was an intellectual resource the team owned.\n\nBear in mind that such resources are difficult to come by because they are less obvious and more ephemeral than physical resources. It\u2019s obvious when hackers need a physical raw material to build a solution. But for intellectual resources hackers might not even know what\u2019s required. For example hackers might need to obtain a patent or license assignment, build a relationship with a Decision-Maker, Champion, or Buyer, neutralize or coop a Saboteur, or understand the current state of advanced research on a specific topic. Intellectual resources are ephemeral because they frequently expire or become obsolete, change without obvious signals or warnings, are notoriously difficult to place a monetary value on, and often have legal ownership or rights risks. Unlike tangible and intangible resources, intellectual resources often cannot simply be bought. They must be earned, and the earning is slow.\n\n## Financial Resources\nAs Ida Tarbell, a journalist writing in the 19th century, noted, \u201cthe first and most imperative necessity in war is money, for money means everything else \u2013 men, guns, ammunition.\u201d The same is true in H4D. Money is an important resource for any team. All solutions require financial resources, investment, or capital to pay for human, tangible, and intangible resources. Capital is also needed to create intellectual resources. Financial resources come from many different sources: investors, government organizations, venture capital, and, in some cases, philanthropic individuals and institutions. Step 10: Mission Cost/Budget delves deeper into the topic of funding.\n\nHuman, tangible, intangible, intellectual, and financial resources are required by all teams to develop and deliver their solution. Resources, again, are dependent on the Key Activities a team must perform. Teams often have more resources at their disposal than they recognize. Determining which to use and when to use them. The Anthro Energy case study below highlights how the team managed to determine which Key Resources they needed and when they needed them.\n\n### Case Study: Anthro Energy\nIn Anthro Energy\u2019s case, they had lots of tangible resources like lab space, chemicals (for battery chemistry), and equipment to develop a battery from the university. They could also tap into a reservoir of subject matter expertise that included world-leading energy researchers, battery engineers, and business and defense experts on their school\u2019s campus and in the school\u2019s alumni network. The students within Anthro Energy\u2019s team also possessed a wealth of knowledge resources. They also had access to modest financial resources through various university programs.", "page_summary": "This page discusses the importance and characteristics of intellectual and financial resources in team-based problem solving, particularly in the context of innovation and defense.

This case study explains how Anthro Energy identified the appropriate Key Resources as they transitioned from learning about the problem and coming up with potential solutions to building and testing those solutions.\n\n**Beneficiaries and Value Propositions Determine Key Activities and Key Resources**\n\nIf you recall, Anthro Energy began the class by working on a Problem Statement to include the battery life of a pilot\u2019s emergency radio. After several weeks of interviews, the team learned that pilots weren\u2019t the team\u2019s initial Beneficiary because pilots could only use a finished battery solution. The team was forced to find a new Beneficiary who was able to work with an incomplete solution and identified the Air Force\u2019s Guardian Angels as this Beneficiary. Changing Beneficiaries altered the team\u2019s Key Activities, which also altered their Key Resources because they went from developing a solution for pilots to needing to find a new Beneficiary.\n\n**Key Activities**\n- Determine military specifications for batteries\n- Network and get buy-in\n- Battery design: Materials, size, shape\n- Battery manufacturing\n\n**Key Resources**\n- Battery manufacturing facility or partner\n- Battery intellectual property rights from Stanford\n- Battery engineers and designers\n\n**Key Activities**\n- Identify Beneficiaries with battery problems\n- Determine which can test early TRL solutions\n- Learn which batteries they are currently using\n- Understand pain points and workflow\n\n**Key Resources**\n- Networks of contacts (specifically uniformed personnel)\n- Equipment/software to design low-fidelity MVPs like PPT\n\nAnthro Energy needed to interview dozens of people to find a new Beneficiary. The Key Resources most important to Anthro Energy during Discovery interviews were relatively simple: intangible resources in the form of PowerPoint (to create MVP mockups) and intellectual resources in the form of human networks the team could leverage to identify and schedule interviews.\n\nAs they progressed, they learned more about which batteries the Guardian Angels carried, how they carried them, and how they would prefer to carry them. Once they had this data, the team mapped the specifications needed, illustrated on the next page, to power Guardian Angel electronics. Doing so would ensure they knew exactly what a new battery must look, work, and feel like for it to be useful. They also wanted to be able to clearly convey the value the Anthro Energy battery would create to make it attractive for Guardian Angels to use.", "page_summary": "This page discusses how Anthro Energy identified and adapted their Key Activities and Key Resources as they shifted their focus from pilots to the Air Force\u2019s Guardian Angels as their primary Beneficiary.

Access to Guardian Angel equipment became an important tangible resource for the team. They needed to see and feel the carrying equipment to better understand how to deliver a battery that integrated into Guardian Angel workflow.\n\n## MVP Part 4: Product Placement\n\nAfter Anthro Energy used PPT mockups like the one illustrated above to validate that Guardian Angels wanted their batteries to be placed against their body armor, the team began developing a battery mockup. The battery mockup wasn\u2019t a battery at all. Rather, it was a non-functioning battery prototype the team used to determine how Guardian Angels needed a battery to fit to optimize mobility and performance. The switch in Key Activities from learning and interviewing to developing and testing meant that Anthro Energy\u2019s Key Resources also had to switch. Tangible resources like lab space, equipment, raw materials, technical battery engineering expertise, and financial resources became important to their progress.\n\nDetermining the Key Resources necessary to perform each Key Activity helped Anthro Energy determine financial resources. Throughout the H4D process the members of Anthro Energy often asked, \u201cwhich Key Resources do our Value Propositions require?\u201d The answer changed as the team advanced from learning and interviewing to developing and testing. In summary, Anthro Energy succeeded because they:\n\n1. Based their Key Resources off the Key Activities the team needed to perform to develop and deliver Value Propositions to Beneficiaries.\n2. Switched the Key Resources they used based on whatever they were learning and validating through interviews or developing technical prototypes.\n3. Ensured that Key Resources aligned exactly with Key Activities.\n\n### Guiding Principles for Key Resources\n- **Be intentionally specific.** Remember to be specific about Key Resources by thinking clearly about which exact resources you need to develop, test, and deliver a solution.

Aligning Key Resources to Key Activities is necessary but hackers should be agile and prepared to shift Key Activities and Key Resources because Beneficiaries, Value Propositions, Mission Achievement, and Deployment all evolve and change.\n- Key Resources are specific to each stage of the H4D process. The Key Resources hackers need to understand the problem are different from the Key Resources needed to test solution prototypes or deploy the solution. Initially focusing on technical and financial resources to develop the solution before understanding the problem doesn\u2019t work. In fact, a common mistake students make with Key Resources relates to timing. Many teams in the early stages of the class list Key Resources like \u201cinvestment capital\u201d or \u201clegal counsel,\u201d but only begin needing these resources after they understand the problem and validate which solution will best address it.

The legendary collaboration of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak revolutionized personal computing, just as the dynamic duo of Batman and Robin captivated popular culture. The power of two or more entities coming together for a common goal has repeatedly proven its worth. This is especially true in the realms of national security and Hacking for Defense.\n\nConsider, for instance, the partnerships between American car manufacturers and the military, or between the military and Hollywood. Movies have been consciously employed to educate, improve morale, and recruit talent since World War II, when director Frank Capra was hand-selected by five-star U.S. Army Gen. George Marshall. Capra\u2019s mission was to craft compelling films to impress upon American troops the gravity of the war and act as a countermeasure against influential Nazi propaganda. Over the course of seven installments entitled *Why We Fight*, Capra\u2019s films not only effectively motivated troops by clarifying their purpose in the war but also resonated so powerfully that President Franklin Roosevelt ordered the series to be made available for public viewing.[63] Recently, the Pentagon funded a portion of *Captain Marvel* while the U.S. Navy chipped in to pay for Tom Cruise\u2019s *Maverick* and the Marines advertise on primetime Super Bowl slots. The reason? People watch the film and are convinced their lives will not be fulfilled until they join the ranks of the U.S. military. Similarly, the Army has sought to boost its drone pilot program by partnering with the gaming industry.[64] Whether the partner is a car company, Hollywood producer, or gaming competitions, the relationship is usually symbiotic; both parties benefit from working together.\n\nNo partnership is more essential to the Defense Department than that with the defense industrial base (DIB). The DIB is a catch-all term for the external \u201cpersons and organizations that are engaged in research, development, production, integration, services, or information technology activities.\u201d[65] These people and organizations supply the beans, bullets, and bandages (aka Key Resources) the Pentagon needs to conduct operations.\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s need for DIB products and services has fostered enduring partnerships between the government and DIB companies ever since the early 1900s, forming the extensive military-industrial complex. The defense-industry relationship became so powerful that President Eisenhower commented on it during his 1961 farewell address, stating, \u201cWe must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.\u201d[66]", "page_summary": "This page discusses the importance of key partnerships in national security and defense, highlighting historical and modern examples such as collaborations between the military and industry, Hollywood, and the gaming sector.

In the 1993 Defense Budget, the Pentagon-industrial partnership tightened when Congress argued for, and mandated, the federal government to have a more active role in shaping the U.S. technology and industrial base. In the 21st century, industry leads technological development and national security organizations are pursuing partnerships with companies with even greater intensity.\n\nThe DIB operates within the military-industrial complex consisting of a vast network encompassing government officials, legislators, and companies involved in producing products and services for federal government consumption. The government relies on the DIB being highly competitive and technologically advanced \u2013 which is good news for hackers with innovative ideas with national security applications. It means that, yes, the government is challenging to work with \u2013 and as we\u2019ve discussed, there are a lot of idiosyncrasies and bureaucratic red tape to work through. But ultimately, the government is always seeking partnerships with smart people with good ideas who can help them achieve their goals more efficiently and effectively.\n\nSo far in the H4D process, hackers and their teams have learned how to iteratively discover a Value Proposition, confirm Buy-In, and determine a good, straight deployment pathway full of Key Activities driven by Key Resources. This step focuses on partnerships. It explains and investigates why teams need partners and the different types of partners and partnerships encountered when hacking. The goal of this chapter is to help hackers identify, form, and leverage partnerships to speed their success.\n\n**Defining Key Partnerships**\n\nH4D teams and newly formed companies rarely own all the Key Resources they use or perform every single one of the Key Activities required to deliver value. Rather, teams form partnerships with individuals and organizations to gain resources and have support in performing required activities. A Key Partner is any individual or organization providing a Key Resource necessary to develop or deploy a solution to a Beneficiary. H4D teams partner to outsource activities because it is cheaper, faster, and more effective than doing it themselves. If a team determines that an optimal deployment pathway is through entering into a contract with a company, then the relationship - however fleeting - is considered a partnership. Key Partnerships are not relationships that need to be persistently managed as with Beneficiaries (Step 1 - Beneficiaries) or Champions, Buyers, and Saboteurs (Step 7 - Buy-In & Support). Rather, Key Partnerships, like the partnerships between the military and car manufacturers, Hollywood, and others in the DIB, must be symbiotic to maximize value for each partner.\n\nIn the MMC, the Key Partnerships box refers to activities and resources teams can outsource to individuals and organizations external to their team. Key Partnerships directly relate to the Key Activities and Key Resources boxes. Key Partners commonly perform Key Activities that are highly urgent activities that are lower in importance (see, the Low Importance, High Urgency quadrant of the Importance-Urgency Matrix in Step 7). Key Partnerships are vital to Key Resources because partners provide the resources teams need to develop and deploy their solution. This relationship, as well as how to link activities to resources, is discussed in detail throughout this step.", "page_summary": "This page discusses the evolution and importance of partnerships between the government and industry in the defense sector, particularly within the Defense Industrial Base (DIB). It introduces the concept of Key Partnerships in the H4D process, explaining why teams need partners, the types of partnerships, and how these relationships help teams access resources and perform activities more efficiently. The section also defines Key Partnerships and their role in supporting key activities and resources, emphasizing the symbiotic nature of these relationships.", "images_interpretations": []}
{"page_number": 162, "screenshot_filename": "page_0162.png", "instructions_model_received": "Extract book content and interpret images based the provided schema.", "page_context": "Developing Key Partnerships is a polygamous business. Hackers are encouraged to partner with several organizations such as companies, government offices, academic institutions, and, sometimes, non-profits. All partnerships are built on reciprocity and should aim to deliver value to both partners. Bear in mind, however, only those that perform the most relevant activities, and provide the best resources, should be considered Key Partners and added to the MMC. A good partnership is crucial to a successful outcome.\n\n## Why Teams Should Partner and With Whom\nEvery company requires more resources than they possess. H4D teams are no different. Teams need to partner to gain a reliable supply of human, tangible, intangible, intellectual, and financial resources. Consequently, the Buyer-Supplier partnership, where one organization supplies the other with goods or services, is the most common form of partnership that exists.\n\nKey Partnerships provide a variety of benefits to hackers. Outsourcing certain resources and activities enables the team to focus on highly urgent and highly important Key Activities that create the team\u2019s secret sauce. Partnering can also increase a team\u2019s access and credibility. In H4D, the nature of relationships, the level of commitment, and the conditions of reciprocity are different for every team. However, most partnerships exist for three general reasons: access to resources, access to the deployment pathways, and increased credibility.\n\n### Partnering for Human, Tangible, and Financial Resources\nBuyer-Supplier partnerships mostly consist of one company providing another with tangible resources, like raw materials or parts, and human resources, such as expertise, knowledge, and skills. A team specializing in rocket propulsion, for instance, might create a partnership with a proposal writer (a human resource) rather than try to train one of their own rocket scientists to write the proposal. In this case, the partnership allows highly trained and specialized rocket scientists to continue to focus on performing the Key Activities necessary to the H4D team\u2019s success. Other areas ripe for partnership come in the form of highly urgent activities that are not classified as being highly important to success, such as legal, accounting, or contracting support, that can be outsourced. As teams form companies, and companies grow, they bring these services back in-house to reduce costs.\n\n### Partnering to Access Deployment Pathways\nAccessing Beneficiaries (and eventually customers) in the government is a difficult, challenging, and arduous process. Identifying End-Users, Decision-Makers, and Buyers, and developing deployment pathways to deliver a solution, requires hard work, a good team, and knowledge of how to navigate the multi-million-person bureaucracy. Thousands of companies within the DIB have existing relationships with the federal government, many of which have deployment pathways hackers can use to deliver their solution to their Beneficiaries. Defense prime contractors, such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, and RTX (the five largest U.S. defense contractors), can be valuable partners for H4D teams because of the intangible resource of deployment pathways they possess. Most defense contractors have been working with the government for decades, produced hundreds of effective solutions, and can access End-Users, Decision-Makers, and Buyers by simply picking up the phone or sending an email. Partnerships with defense contractors and established companies are vital because they can accelerate the time it takes hackers to gain access to Beneficiaries and have the deployment pathways in place to decrease the time it takes to deliver", "page_summary": "This page discusses the importance of developing key partnerships for H4D (Hacking for Defense) teams. It explains why teams should partner, the types of resources partnerships can provide, and the benefits of outsourcing certain activities. The text highlights the value of Buyer-Supplier partnerships for accessing human, tangible, and financial resources, and emphasizes the critical role of partnerships in accessing deployment pathways, especially within the government and defense sectors.", "images_interpretations": []}
{"page_number": 163, "screenshot_filename": "page_0163.png", "instructions_model_received": "Extract book content and interpret images based the provided schema.", "page_context": "## Partner to Gain Credibility\n\nHackers also partner to gain the intangible resources of brand and credibility. Even if a deployment pathway is established, and access granted, H4D teams and new companies often lack the credibility necessary to deploy their solution. The government has no guarantee new companies can deliver and don\u2019t even know if they will exist in a year. As such, the government prefers to work with tried and tested companies with a proven track record of performing the work. Doing so reduces the risk, inefficiencies, and uncertainty involved in a transaction with an H4D team or a new company. To overcome this problem, H4D teams and companies new to the defense market benefit from partnering with companies that have a history of government performance. Partnering with a company that has a good track record will give less-experienced partners the credibility necessary to deliver solutions to their Beneficiary and/or capture a greater market share.\n\n## Consider Partnering with Competitors, Non-Competitors, and Government Organizations\n\nHackers should consider partnerships with competitors, non-competitors, and government organizations alike. Partnering with competitors that deliver similar products but to different Beneficiaries, or at the very least interviewing them, can be useful because they inform a H4D team of compliance requirements - certifications, licenses, and tests - to be satisfied when delivering solutions to government Beneficiaries. Competitive partnerships can teach an inexperienced team how to deliver a solution and, done well, can be reciprocal. While an H4D team gains access, expertise, and credibility, the partnering organization may get access to new customers and gain novel insights. In some cases, outright competitors might partner to increase the size of the market or invest in a young company to build an even closer relationship. Multiple drone manufacturers, for instance, joined forces to advocate for specific Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations that benefit the entire industry.\n\nH4D teams should consider non-competitive partnerships with organizations that have a history of delivering different products and services to the same Beneficiary with complementary solutions. A rocket propulsion company, for example, might partner with a space shuttle manufacturer to increase market awareness and credibility of both companies. Team Learn to Win, for example, had a commercially successful solution but was having difficulty deploying it because the Pentagon viewed them as a risk. To mitigate the risk, Learn to Win partnered with CACI International and Deloitte to legitimize its solution in the eyes of the government.\n\nPartnerships with government organizations are also valuable to hackers. There are hundreds of organizations that teams do not classify as End-Users, Decision-Makers, Buyers, or Champions that serve as third parties connecting H4D teams to these archetypes. Each military department has these organizations like the Air Force\u2019s AFWERX, the Army\u2019s Army Applications Laboratory, the Navy\u2019s Tech Bridges, and the Office of Secretary of Defense\u2019s.", "page_summary": "This page discusses the importance of partnerships for H4D teams and hackers, focusing on gaining credibility, reducing risk, and increasing market access.

It highlights the importance different partnerships can play in accelerating company traction and growth. In addition, the case study provides a model for how teams can think about partnering to develop and deploy their solution to the people who need it the most.\n\n## Case Study: Capella Space\u2019s Partnerships in the Defense and Commercial Sectors\n\nFollowing the completion of the inaugural Hacking for Defense class at Stanford University in June 2016, the H4D team-turned-company, Capella Space, formed partnerships to deliver its satellites to several government organizations. Building on the foundation laid in class, the company embarked on a mission to revolutionize Earth observation using synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) technology. Payam Banazadeh, H4D veteran and the founder of Capella Space, confidently stated that, \u201cOur SAR technology revolutionizes how we observe our planet, offering clarity and precision that were previously unattainable.\u201d However, despite Capella Space\u2019s world-leading tech, the company, like any other, faced the challenge of establishing itself as a leader in the defense sector. Partnerships with defense organizations and companies enabled Capella Space to quickly become a disrupter in the defense sector, garnering attention for its innovative approach to Earth observation. Key Partnerships were a critical component of their success.\n\n### Partnering with the Defense Innovation Unit\n\nThe first partnership Capella Space formed with a national security organization was with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU). DIU is the only organization in the Pentagon \u201cfocused on accelerating the adoption of commercial technology at speed and scale.\u201d Just eleven months after beginning Hacking for Defense, DIU awarded Capella Space a $4 million contract to provide SAR-enabled satellites to the Defense Department. The partnership was a triple win for the Defense Department, DIU, and Capella Space. The Defense Department benefited by gaining powerful commercial technology that enhanced surveillance and intelligence capabilities necessary to maintain the technological lead in space. These high-resolution SAR imagery solutions have enabled more effective monitoring and analysis of global developments, essential for defense planning and operations. DIU benefited from leading the partnership with Capella Space because it carried out its mandate. The partnership provided Capella Space with a deployment pathway to defense End-Users, financial resources to further develop their technology, and the chance to begin establishing the company as a credible and reliable source for imagery.\n\nAs a result of the infusion of funding, Capella Space launched its first test satellite in December 2018, demonstrating the value of SAR capabilities to national security and defense. The test gave Capella Space credibility since it proved that its platform could provide the critical insights it promised. Proving the value of the system led to additional partnerships and government contracts. Government funding, proven success, and increased credibility also enabled Capella Space to gain financial resources from investors.", "page_summary": "This page presents a case study on Capella Space\u2019s strategic partnerships, particularly with the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), which helped the company gain traction in the defense sector.

Teams and companies that conduct deep Beneficiary Discovery are more likely to form these partnerships because they can communicate to middlemen organizations exactly the type of value they add and to whom they add it. Like Capella Space, Anthro Energy leveraged its Beneficiary Discovery insights to form a partnership with the Defense Innovation Unit\u2019s National Security Innovation Capital program.\n\n**Partnering with the Army for increased access**\n\nFollowing the work with DIU, Capella Space also created a partnership with the U.S. Army\u2019s Space and Missile Defense Technical Center (SMDTC) to conduct simulations and testing alongside the organization. The partnership, officially called a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA), was created for the purpose of access. Capella Space sought to work closely with government customers in a secure environment to gain a deeper understanding of Army challenges so it could develop products to overcome those challenges. The Army sought to access Capella\u2019s SAR data to understand how the capability could be valuable to achieving Army goals. The Capella Space-SMDTC partnership was one of information and access and not immediately about revenue. Payam viewed the partnerships as a critical \u201cfirst step toward establishing an official contract with a government agency.\u201d According to the SMDTC director, the Army benefited from the partnership too, explaining that, \u201cCapella is the first U.S. company to commercialize SAR and is uniquely positioned to provide mission-critical support to tactical users and advance the Army\u2019s critical mission.\u201d This partnership exemplifies core Hacking for Defense principles of forging symbiotic partnerships that enhance learning and hold the promise of solving defense problems through deploying a solution.\n\n**Partnering for human and tangible Resources and access**\n\nPartnerships with DIU and SMDTC provided Capella Space with access, a steady flow of resources, and earned credibility. Capella Space formed a partnership with Mynaric, a non-competitive optical communications company, to gain critical access and resources. As a result, they were awarded a contract from the Space Development Agency (SDA). The Capella-Mynaric partnership was effective because it was reciprocal. Mynaric provided Capella satellites with optical communications terminals components (tangible resources), increasing their value to the SDA. Mynaric was also valuable to Capella Space because of its intangible resources, namely its experience working with the SDA. This indicated that it was capable of meeting SDA requirements and specifications, ensuring the Capella-Mynaric product was fully compliant with the SDA\u2019s systems and standards. The partnership thus reduced the uncertainty the SDA had for awarding Capella Space the contract. For its part, Mynaric was able to leverage Capella\u2019s SAR technology to gain additional work with the SDA.\n\nPartnerships like these enabled the newcomer Capella Space to become the world leader in SAR technologies, gaining endorsements from some of the most senior people in the government. In response to the SDA contract, Lt. Gen. John \u201cJ. T.\u201d Thompson, the Air Force\u2019s Space and Missile Systems Center commander, commented that, \u201cThe U.S. Air Force is always working to maintain our leadership as a global technology innovator, and this contract [with Capella Space] is a testament to that commitment.\u201d A senior intelligence officer stated, \u201cCapella\u2019s SAR technology has become an", "page_summary": "This page discusses Capella Space's strategic partnerships with government organizations such as the U.S. Army\u2019s SMDTC and the Defense Innovation Unit, as well as with private companies like Mynaric.

After Capella Space secured the first DIU award, the company became more credible and less risky to other defense organizations, helping them gain additional contracts. Credibility also enabled greater access not only to defense and commercial customers, but also suppliers interested in providing resources to Capella.\n\nCapella Space\u2019s recognition of the fundamental importance of partnerships is epitomized in Capella\u2019s offshoot Capella Federal, a subsidiary they launched in 2023 specifically to focus on government and defense agency customers. The relationships they forged with the Pentagon since becoming a company enabled them to secure valuable human resources. The former Assistant Director of the Central Intelligence Agency for the Near East came on as the President of Capella Federal and the former Director of Operations in the U.S. Special Operations Command serves as the Chairman of their Board of Directors. These appointments exemplify the work Capella Space did to gain Buy-In and Support from key Decision-Makers throughout the Defense Department and successfully turn them into Champions willing to take on significant roles in the company.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re redefining the future of defense technology and our work with the government is just the beginning,\u201d noted Payam, \u201cWe would have never been successful without Hacking for Defense.\u201d As of the time of this writing, Capella Space customers now include the U.S. Army, the National Reconnaissance Office, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, and U.S. Space Force. Forming Key Partnerships had a lot to do with Capella Space\u2019s success.\n\n## Guiding Principles for Key Partnerships\n\nThe goal in H4D is always to maximize value and minimize time and resource costs. This equation is also the focus when forming Key Partnerships. Key Partners drive down costs by outsourcing non-critical activities and providing important resources. Below are four guiding principles for forming valuable Key Partnerships.\n\n- **Strong partnerships are symbiotic.** In forming a partnership, hackers seek partners that provide value the team needs and the team provides value to the partner. The partnerships must be reciprocal, or the partnerships will not endure. Understand what you need a partner to deliver and what value your partner will receive from you. Knowing your needs and how a potential partner will benefit indicate potential partnerships. Capturing any old organization in the Key Partnerships box is not good practice. Hackers should aim to seek potential partners based on the partner\u2019s interest in the team\u2019s solution, how the partner feels about the team (and vice-versa), and the level of reciprocity. Therefore, the first stage of forming the partnership is to identify potential partners and then determine whether the relationship can be symbiotic.", "page_summary": "This page discusses the importance of partnerships in Capella Space's growth, especially in the defense sector, and introduces guiding principles for forming key partnerships in the Hacking for Defense (H4D) methodology.

The page also outlines the first principle for forming valuable partnerships: ensuring relationships are symbiotic and mutually beneficial.", "images_interpretations": []}
{"page_number": 167, "screenshot_filename": "page_0167.png", "instructions_model_received": "Extract book content and interpret images based the provided schema.", "page_context": "- **Partners are valuable to helping teams gain traction.** H4D teams initially pursue partnerships that can provide access to information to learn about the problem they are solving and for whom, and how a solution should deliver value. As such, human resources, like expertise, and intangible resources, like access and credibility, are the most important assets to gain from early partnerships. Partnerships are not only about money: Information and access can often be just as valuable. Capella Space sought to work closely with government partners in a secure environment and gain a deeper understanding of SMDTC and Army challenges so it could develop products to overcome those challenges. The partnership between SMDTC and Capella Space didn\u2019t have any funding attached to it, but helped Capella Space gain insights and credibility since it proved that its platform could provide the critical insights it promised. Forming early partnerships with government organizations opens doors leading to follow-on connections and funding.\n\n- **Great partnerships are more than transactional.** Consider partnerships with competitors, non-competitors, and government organizations. It usually takes a bit of time to figure out who is who. The most powerful partnerships are more than strictly transactional. Associating with quality companies will increase trust in your product. Capella Space\u2019s partnerships with Mynaric reduced the uncertainty the SDA had for awarding Capella Space the contract. For its part, Mynaric was able to leverage Capella\u2019s SAR technology to gain additional work with the SDA. The partnership benefited both beyond being purely transactional. Building positive partnerships creates new relationship opportunities. Done correctly, opportunities cascade.\n\n- **Avoid outsourcing your secret sauce.** While partnering has its benefits, teams should only engage partners to perform activities that they do not have the capacity, will, or competency to perform. Avoid farming out Key Activities or core internal competencies that are central to delivering value to Beneficiaries. Examples of core competencies that must be performed internally are designing the solution, analyzing the solution\u2019s performance, and determining how all the component parts of a solution fit and work together. Outsourcing core competencies is effectively outsourcing the team\u2019s secret sauce.\n\nSee commonmission.us/h4d-manual for examples of Key Partnerships slides.\n\n## Application and Tasks\n\nConsider the following questions to assist in identifying Key Partnerships relevant to your team and performing the tasks below. These questions can be useful prompts for internal team discussions as well as questions to ask during interviews.\n\n- Who are our Key Partners/Suppliers?\n- Which resources could we acquire from partners?\n- Which activities might partners perform for us?\n- Which partnerships are critical to our business?\n- Which partnerships do we bring critical capabilities to?\n- What type of partnerships would suit our needs?\n- Whose brand could we leverage to build our credibility?", "page_summary": "This page discusses the value of partnerships for teams, emphasizing that early partnerships provide access, credibility, and insights rather than just funding.

National security analysts needed to aggregate and analyze myriad data to track terrorists\u2019 movements. The Pentagon attempted to address this by building a platform called the U.S. Army Distributed Common Ground System-Army (DCGS-A). Development sought to integrate over 600 separate streams of information, from drones to ground sensors to GPS satellites, into a common format and depository.[73] The enormous project was mired by unforeseen complexity and costs. DCGS-A never became fully functional.\n\nPalantir, the multi-billion dollar self-described \u201cdata-mining juggernaut,\u201d approached the problem using a process similar to the H4D process, one that focused on iterative design.[74] Peter Thiel founded Palantir in 2004 with the idea that a PayPal (Thiel was a cofounder) algorithm could be built upon to track terrorists through financial transactions. Palantir deployed early versions of their data-mining software to the CIA and Special Operations for free[75] to learn the problems analysts faced and the value needed to track terrorists.[76] Palantir realized analysts needed to create a coherent battlefield narrative by accessing data related to Iraq and Afghanistan, not hundreds of databases. In the end, Palantir\u2019s system cost the Pentagon $356.8 million and took nine years to create.[77] Compare this to the nearly $6 billion cost of DCGS-A.[78]\n\nSure, the U.S. government spends roughly $1 trillion on national security annually. But with hundreds of organizations with tens of thousands of objectives, the funding is spread thinly amongst End-User, Decision-Maker, and Buyer organizations. Cost matters. The DCGS-A and Palantir example brings us to the key lesson of this chapter: The best solution is always the one capable of delivering Beneficiaries value *and* at the lowest cost, not the solution with the most advanced technologies or with the most features.\n\nThus far, hackers have learned to identify the value Beneficiaries need to solve a problem. Hackers use agile development to create minimum viable products (MVP) that test and validate which features are necessary or \u201cneed-to-have.\u201d Step 10: Mission Cost offers a reality check to H4D teams by posting two questions: What is the cost of the solution? Do Beneficiaries have the budget to buy it? The aim of this chapter is to provide hackers with the knowledge, tools, and real-world examples needed to answer these questions.

A solution with a Mission Cost that exceeds an organization\u2019s ability to pay (Mission Budget) will not be purchased and shouldn\u2019t be developed no matter how many Value Propositions or Mission Achievement Factors it delivers.\n\n## Estimating Costs\nMission Cost is primarily calculated based on items listed in the Key Activities and Key Resources boxes and, to a lesser extent, managing key Buy-In and Support people and the cost-savings that come from establishing Key Partnerships. There are two important categories within Mission Cost that need to be identified: fixed costs and variable costs.\n\n**Fixed Costs**\nFixed costs are expenses that don\u2019t change with an increase or decrease in the number of products or services produced. Examples of fixed costs are salaries, web hosting, renting office space or equipment, and utilities. Of course, in the long term, fixed costs will increase as a company grows, like a larger office, but these are held constant, or fixed, in the short term. In H4D, common fixed costs students incur are software licensing fees and paying to incorporate a company.\n\n**Variable Costs**\nUnlike fixed costs, variable expenses are costs that change as production changes. Variable costs rise as production increases and fall as production decreases. The more goods the manufacturer produces, the more raw materials they must buy and the more labor is required. Common examples of variable costs for H4D teams are hourly labor and materials.\n\nAdding fixed and variable costs together gives hackers a Mission Cost estimate. Creating a cost estimate is a prerequisite to determining whether a Beneficiary can afford a hacker\u2019s solution. No matter how great a team\u2019s solution might be, and as enthusiastic as their potential users are, unless the hackers estimate their solution\u2019s Mission Cost, they can\u2019t know if their Beneficiaries are willing to pay the price and whether it fits into their Mission Budget.\n\n## Case Study: Learn to Win - Determining Solution Viability\n*Note that all dollar amounts used about the team are hypothetical.*\n\nPilot training in the U.S. Air Force hadn\u2019t changed in forty years and was inhibiting the Air Force\u2019s ability to produce the pilots necessary to fly missions. As described in the opening vignette to Part IV, the training process relied heavily on paper-based learning and obsolete computers. Trainees would graduate to fly some of the world\u2019s most advanced aircraft but used antiquated technologies in preparing for the job. Team Learn to Win (L2W)", "page_summary": "This page explains how to estimate Mission Cost for solutions in the H4D framework, distinguishing between fixed and variable costs, and why understanding these costs is crucial for solution viability.

L2W was surprised to discover that pilot training was approximately 90% classroom hours and only 10% flight hours. The team was also shocked to learn about the training materials used by pilot trainees. Trainees either studied from a six-inch-thick 3-ring binder or drove 20-30 minutes to a computer lab on the Air Force base where they would spend 30 minutes booting up the desktop computer before taking a floppy-disk-era lesson, receiving a grade, and then handwriting the grade into another binder. Pilot trainees didn\u2019t always have their binders with them or the time to visit the computer lab. Consequently, they studied infrequently for long durations of time which is scientifically proven to be less effective for learning than studying frequently for shorter durations.[79] As a result, only half of the 500 pilot trainees graduated on time. The 50% graduation rate deeply concerned the Air Combat Command leadership about its ability to produce the pilots air operations required.\n\nAfter eight weeks of learning, L2W discovered three key lessons. First, the team knew they could use their commercial product to help the Air Force train pilots. Second, they knew that training Air Force E-3 and U-2 pilots required far more work than simply relabeling their existing product for military use. L2W had the opportunity to revolutionize pilot training but needed to learn the details of the Air Force\u2019s training program to tailor-make a solution. Third, L2W learned that End-Users and Decision-Makers were excited about their solution. Decision-Makers were particularly interested in using a new solution to achieve the Mission Achievement Factor of increasing pilot trainee graduation rates from 50% to 75%. One Decision-Maker excitedly said, \u201cI needed this solution yesterday!\u201d What L2W didn\u2019t know was if their Beneficiaries had the budget to pay for their solution. To learn this, the team needed to calculate their Mission Cost.\n\n## Estimating the Mission Cost of a L2W Solution\n\nL2W had a great list of Key Activities and Key Resources. L2W even categorized the types of costs in the Mission Cost box. However, the information wasn\u2019t sufficient to estimate the team\u2019s Mission Cost. L2W needed to quantify costs into dollar amounts to estimate Mission Cost.\n\nThe team began quantifying their Key Activities and Key Resources by re-reading their interview notes looking for costing information. The team knew that obtaining U-2 and E-3 training materials was free as their Problem Sponsor was willing to provide them. L2W estimated that they needed roughly $40,000 to conduct 400 hours of software design, engineering, and lesson planning, another $10,000 for travel to conduct face-to-face meetings with their Beneficiaries, and $5,000 to cover the team\u2019s time.[tttt] L2W aimed to keep costs low by delivering a solution that focused only on boosting graduation rates (the MAF their Decision-Maker cared most about). The team cut out the other \u201cnice-to-have\u201d features like accelerating training time and making it easier for instructors to teach the coursework. L2W estimated they could deliver a prototype for an estimated cost of $55,000.", "page_summary": "This page describes how the L2W team learned about inefficiencies in Air Force pilot training and identified opportunities to improve graduation rates using their commercial product.

The team knew that asking, \u201cWould you pay $55,000 for a prototype?\u201d would lead to bad data because they wouldn\u2019t know if they were getting straight answers unless the interviewee wrote them a check on the spot. To avoid bad data, L2W took a two-pronged approach focused on learning about how much their Beneficiaries were currently spending on the existing solution and their Beneficiaries\u2019 willingness to use their Mission Budget to increase pilot trainee graduation rates.\n\n#### Learning the Cost of the Existing Solution\nBefore beginning Mission Cost/Budget interviews, L2W conducted research on databases listing existing government contracts, like grants.gov, to learn how much the Air Force and their Air Combat Command Beneficiary was spending on pilot training. This is a common practice in industry called \u201creference pricing\u201d and is one of the most valuable metrics for establishing pricing. The information wasn\u2019t specific to the E-3/U-2 pilot training programs but provided the team with a general sense of pilot training spending which helped them prepare for the interviews.\n\nL2W interviewed nearly a dozen Buyers and Decision-Makers in the Air Combat Command to get the details of the existing solution\u2019s cost. In particular, the team focused on learning the following pieces of information:\n\n- **Initial Purchase Price:** Cost of acquiring the solution.\n- **Installation and Setup:** Expenses related to setting up and configuring the solution.\n- **Training Costs:** Costs associated with training employees to use the new solution effectively.\n- **Maintenance and Support:** Ongoing expenses for maintaining and updating the solution.\n- **Unexpected Costs:** Contingency funds for unforeseen expenses related to the solution.\n\nDiscussing the general cost data they gathered through research and focusing on the existing solution facilitated candid conversations with Buyer and Decision-Maker interviewees. L2W learned that the existing solution cost the Air Combat Command between $2-3 million per year including costs like facilities, instructor salaries, and technology.\n\nThe team\u2019s deepest insights came from discussing the unexpected costs. When a pilot trainee failed any portion of the training, they had to retake the failed portion and test again after the 9-month training cycle ended. The Air Combat Command paid for the trainee\u2019s housing, food, and living expenses while they relearned the material which took an average of four weeks.", "page_summary": "This page discusses how the L2W team estimated the mission cost for a new training solution and researched the cost of existing solutions for Air Combat Command.

{"page_number": 173, "screenshot_filename": "page_0173.png", "instructions_model_received": "Extract book content and interpret images based the provided schema.", "page_context": "Following the interviews, L2W did the math. Each failed student cost the Air Combat Command $6,000 ($1,500/week x 4 weeks). The team\u2019s solution only needed to graduate 10 students more (an increase of 4%) to more than cover their $55,000 Mission Cost. L2W needed to learn if the Air Combat Command was willing to use their Mission Budget to achieve these figures.\n\n## Learning about Mission Budget\n\nL2W conducted another round of interviews to learn about Decision-Makers, their Mission Budget, and whether Decision-Makers were interested in leveraging their Mission Budget to meet their goal. To get the conversation started, L2W developed a PowerPoint MVP they showed interviewees highlighting the MAFs, the cost of the existing solution, and what the value of an improved solution might look like.\n\n| Mission Achievement Factors | Existing Solution         | Improved Training Solution      |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Number of graduates        | 50% (250/500)            | 60% (300/500)                   |\n| Cost                      | $2\u20133M (+$1.5M extra)     | $55K (<-$95K savings)            |\n\nL2W began their interviews with Decision-Makers by showing the first two columns (Mission Achievement Factors and Existing Solution) to discuss the existing solution and its costs. L2W began the conversation stating, \u201cThe existing solution graduates 250 pilot trainees out of 500 every nine months and costs you roughly $4 million. What is your budget for increasing graduation rates from 50% to 75%?\u201d After discussing, they asked, \u201cHow much could you spend to reach that number?\u201d L2W focused on asking open-ended questions so the interviewee could tell a story. L2W was careful not to pitch their solution. They were in learning mode.\n\nAfter gaining positive feedback about Decision-Maker willingness to put resources towards improving graduations rates, The team then presented the third column (Improved Training Solution) to assess whether Decision-Makers had the interest and budget to pilot a hypothetical solution that increased graduation rates to 10%, which was short of the Decision-Maker goal of 75%.\n\nThe team asked their interviewees if they would consider spending an additional $55,000 to increase the graduation rate by 10% and save $150,000 in costs. L2W discussed 10% because they were confident they could achieve this increase with a prototype within three months. The interviewees appreciated how L2W quantified, in a realistic way, the advantages of an improved solution could provide. One interviewee said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to offend anybody here, but the money we spend on [existing solution] is a waste \u2013 we should be using this instead.\u201d The response from all Air Combat Command interviewees was a unanimous and emphatic \u201cyes\u201d! L2W validated that the Mission Cost of their Solution and their Air Combat Command Beneficiary\u2019s Mission Budget were in alignment. Their solution was viable!\n\nUsing an MVP to frame the discussion around the existing solution was valuable because the conversation was based on something concrete (the", "page_summary": "This page discusses how L2W used interviews and a PowerPoint MVP to explore whether Air Combat Command decision-makers would use their Mission Budget to fund a solution that increases pilot graduation rates.

The team\u2019s solution raised the graduation rate to 75%, saving the Air Force roughly $750,000 (125 additional graduates x $6,000 in remedial training costs). L2W\u2019s work understanding the pilot training problem and the merits of existing and potential solutions earned them an \u201cA\u201d in the class. It also laid the foundation for the team to become a company that trains tens of thousands of government customers and has a valuation of $100 million after being in business only 5 years. While L2W is the epitome of an H4D success, the team\u2019s success would have been missed had they overlooked Mission Cost and Mission Budget.\n\n## Guiding Principles for Mission Budget/Cost\n\n- **Calculate Mission Cost.** Calculating a solution\u2019s Mission Cost is necessary to determine if a Beneficiary has the Mission Budget to support the solution. L2W calculated their Mission Cost and assessed the cost of existing solutions to validate that their solution was viable. Most importantly, L2W did this without mentioning their solution.\n- **Stay hyper-focused on the Mission Achievement Factors and don\u2019t try to add extraneous features.** Getting distracted by adding too many nice-to-have features or targeting too many Beneficiaries will drive up costs without adding proportionate value to each Beneficiary. While you may end up with a solution that addresses several Beneficiaries\u2019 problems, if you try to do too much you may end up with a product that is too expensive for any one Beneficiary to justify acquiring.\n- **Use Key Activities and Key Resources to estimate your costs and always update the MMC.** Use the Key Activities and Key Resource boxes in your Mission Model Canvas to determine the types of costs that will be incurred developing your solution prototype, then quantify them in dollars. Like the other blocks in the MMC, it\u2019s okay to make a guess and then validate that guess during the interviews. Using Beneficiary Discovery to understand Mission Budget/Cost and analyze patterns of value Beneficiaries assign to a solution is essential. Doing so will give you a strong sense of what Beneficiaries (Buyers and Decision-Makers) care about, how they measure it, and how much they\u2019ll pay to achieve their Mission Achievement Factors.", "page_summary": "This page concludes the case study of L2W, highlighting how their focus on Mission Cost and Mission Budget led to significant savings and success.

Discussing the existing solution will lead to insights about which MAFs matter most and how they are measured. Focusing on the existing solution also focuses the conversation around something concrete which leads to accurate and unbiased feedback. Once teams have cost data and an understanding of Mission Achievement Factors, they can lead the conversation to address how much Beneficiaries are willing to pay to get the results they want.\n\nSee [commonmission.us/h4d-manual](http://commonmission.us/h4d-manual) for examples of Mission Budget/Cost slides.\n\n# Application and Tasks\n\n## Task 1: Estimate the costs of your intended solution prototype [30 mins]\nRevisit the Key Activities and Key Resources boxes of your MMC. Determine which 2-3 Key Activities and Key Resources are of immediate importance, categorize them as Fixed or Variable costs, quantify them, and then add the costs together for an estimated cost of a solution prototype. Some teams may also want to include costs associated with Buy-In and Support or the benefits of Key Partnerships. The goal is to get a ballpark figure or a range of cost. Some questions that will help you tackle the Mission Budget/Cost building block are:\n\n- What are the largest costs you\u2019ll incur to deliver your solution(s)? (Hint: Some of you may be considering multiple solutions. As such, you\u2019ll need to break each of these solutions into differing Mission Budget/Cost categories.)\n- Look at the Key Resources and Key Activities that you outlined in your MMC. How much will it cost to acquire those resources and perform those activities? It\u2019s all right to guess or assign a cost range to them.\n  - Which Key Resources are the most expensive?\n  - Which Key Activities are the most expensive?\n\nNext, consider which of the costs you listed are fixed and which are variable. Determine which of your costs are fixed (i.e., will not change) as you create more solutions and which are variable (i.e., will change). Examples of fixed costs are rent, maintenance, and salaries. Examples of variable costs are raw materials and production supplies. It is highly likely that the cost of producing one solution will be higher than producing 100. This information is valuable if your Beneficiary needs just one solution or 1000 to consider adopting it.\n\n## Task 2: Determine the details of the existing solution\u2019s cost [30 mins]\nAsking Beneficiaries, Decision-Makers, and Buyers if they would buy your solution for $x leads to useless data. Instead, focus on the existing solution to get a sense of your Beneficiary\u2019s Mission Budget.

Be sure to search for keywords about the solution and/or the company producing it and/or the government organization using the solution. Interviews will reveal the details of the expenses.

Are they ripping your solution out of your hands?\n- Value Propositions: What value do they need from a solution to solve an intense need?\n- Mission Achievement Factors: How does solving the problem translate to mission success for decision-makers?

How can each be used to support delivery?\n- Deployment: Do you have a viable path for exploring government sales?\n- Key Activities: Do you have a plan for performing them?\n- Key Resources: Which resources do you need to perform your key activities?\n- Key Partnerships: Who are potential partners that will help accelerate your progress and save you time and resources? Do you have a plan for making the partnerships mutually beneficial?\n- Mission Cost/Budget: Do your solution costs align with the mission budget of your beneficiary?

Second, you could provide your learning to a company or organization that can build on your work by either developing or deploying a solution that supports your Beneficiaries.\n\nFirst, meet with your Problem Sponsor and the most ardent End-Users, Decision-Makers, and Champions that supported your team throughout the course.

It is highly likely that this company/organization hasn\u2019t even thought about selling to the government or, more specifically, addressing your Beneficiaries. Spending an hour with them discussing your work, their solution, and recommending potential Beneficiaries that could be potential customers, the Value Propositions and Mission Achievement Factors they seek, and deployment pathways will immensely help them identify new government customers and deliver a product or service that addresses the problems and intense needs you identified.\n\nIf you\u2019re not interested in pursuing your H4D project by forming a company and would like to spend more time handing off your learning to the government, consider the National Security Innovation Network\u2019s X-Force program. This competitive summer fellowship provides students with a paid opportunity to do just that.\n\nDon\u2019t let your hard work be for naught.

Most hackers take the class, get credit, and move on. This is perfectly fine. The goal to the class is to learn how to develop and deliver solutions. Not to create a solution. Considering your work in H4D will help you prepare for what\u2019s next. The key to preparing for \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d not only involves recognizing what you\u2019ve learned, but also appreciating what applying the process in class has taught you about yourself.\n\nSpend half an hour reflecting on your H4D experience. You\u2019ve already spent more than 100 hours, what\u2019s another 30 minutes? I\u2019ve had countless meetings with hackers interested in gaining my input on what careers and opportunities they should pursue next. Of course, I can\u2019t answer these questions for them (or for you, for that matter). The conversations hackers and I have center on their H4D experiences and are aimed at identifying their unique skills, interests, and goals by using their class experience as the focal point. The conversation typically involves me asking questions like:\n\n- What did you like about the project? What did you hate?\n- Were you energized by interviewing strangers? Did you prefer to do more focused work behind the scenes?\n- Did you like conceptualizing and building MVPs and testing them or did you prefer researching information about the problem, solution, and people to interview?\n- What did and didn\u2019t you like about working with some of the people on your team? Which types of people did you like interacting with and which did you recoil from?\n- Did you like the uncertainty of solving a broad problem with an unknown solution? Would you have preferred to work on a more bounded problem?\n\nI admit, it sounds cheesy, but each of these questions offers clues into which professional environments (e.g., the people you work with, the pace of operations) and types of work will get you out of bed in the morning and energized to go to work. Gaining clarity here offers insights into which opportunities to pursue. If you find these questions to be helpful and provocative, take a look at a book by my Stanford colleague Bill Burnett entitled *Designing Your Life*. The pages of the book are filled with questions and exercises that will add further clarity.\n\nHackers before you have found that the most applicable and immediate benefit for hackers wishing to move onto new opportunities is to apply their H4D experience during job interviews. The entire purpose of a job interview is for the interviewee to describe their experiences so the potential employer can determine if they have what it takes to be successful. Getting through this class proves that you have what it takes. H4D has given you a cache of experiences you can leverage to ace an interview. Some of the most common questions interviewers ask. Most, if not all, can be addressed by the experience you just had. Don\u2019t believe me? Just think about questions like:\n\n- Describe a time when you tackled a difficult problem?\n- How have you applied your coursework to the real world?", "page_summary": "This page discusses the value of reflecting on the H4D class experience, even if students do not continue their projects. It encourages students to use their experiences to identify personal strengths and preferences, and to leverage these insights in job interviews. The page provides reflective questions to help students clarify their interests and skills, and highlights how H4D experience can be used to answer common interview questions.", "images_interpretations": []}
{"page_number": 181, "screenshot_filename": "page_0181.png", "instructions_model_received": "Extract book content and interpret images based the provided schema.", "page_context": "### Common Interview Questions\n- What are your strengths? Describe a time when you used them.\n- What are your weaknesses? Describe how you learned this.\n- Tell me about a time you worked in a team?\n- How do you handle working in a stressful environment?\n- What would you do in a difficult situation where you didn\u2019t know what to do?\n- Why should we hire you?\n- What is your greatest accomplishment?\n\nYour work problem-solving in a fast-paced environment dealing with chaos, within a team of diverse people, provides details useful to answering these questions in a way that will \u201cwow\u201d your interviewer. More generally, you just conducted dozens of interviews. The interview environment isn\u2019t anything new. Knowing this will give you a sense of ease, even if it\u2019s you being interviewed this time. Before you put H4D in your rearview mirror, pause and take a moment to reflect on what H4D has taught you about yourself. These lessons can be used to determine which opportunity is right for you and help you land the opportunity that is best for you.\n\n---\n\n### Option #3: Get a job in the problem space\nMany of the problem spaces hackers worked in are large enough, and the expertise required to master them is deep enough, to encompass an entire career. Continuing your work can be accomplished by getting a job working in the same problem space with a government or private industry organization. As mentioned in the Key Partnerships chapter, the defense-industrial base (DIB) includes thousands of companies. If you\u2019ve been inspired by your set of H4D problems and possible solutions, there are many opportunities to leverage your expertise that will make a difference. National security after all rests on a wide foundation of industrial, research, and governmental capabilities, with no end of problems to be solved.\n\nHackers wishing to continue working on their project can seek employment in all manner of companies, from early-stage startups like Anthro Energy and Learn to Win to experienced companies like Anduril and Palantir, as well as prime defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Boeing. Hackers can also work on them directly for the government. The experience and knowledge you\u2019ve built up are valuable to all of these types of employers.\n\nPursuing a career or job relating to an H4D project is particularly interesting to hackers who love working on their H4D project but aren\u2019t interested in the chaos, risk, and volatility that comes with starting a new company. These hackers tend to gravitate towards performing specific and focused tasks, as opposed to being responsible for everything from engineering and sales to accounting and cleaning the bathroom. These hackers also tend to be honest about their H4D project\u2019s progress. If looking at the checklist presented earlier in the chapter reveals several gaps or if you find your insides stirring with enthusiasm to pursue answering a specific set of these questions, like focusing on engineering a solution or concentrating on sales, then pursuing your project through another organization might be a good direction to head.\n\nHackers falling into this category have several resources to support them. First, and foremost, is your newly minted H4D network of interviewees. It is highly likely that someone you\u2019ve interviewed has ideas about which companies would be interested in your work and could introduce you to your next employer. A second option is the Defense Tech Jobs board website (created by an H4D graduate) that lists open positions at a number of companies working in the defense sector. A third, and more general", "page_summary": "This page provides guidance for individuals finishing the H4D program, focusing on how to leverage their experience in interviews and career opportunities. It lists common interview questions and encourages reflection on lessons learned. The main section discusses 'Option #3: Get a job in the problem space,' explaining how participants can continue their work by seeking employment in government, private industry, or defense-related organizations. It highlights the value of H4D experience, the types of companies to consider, and resources like the H4D network and job boards to support career transitions.", "images_interpretations": []}
{"page_number": 182, "screenshot_filename": "page_0182.png", "instructions_model_received": "Extract book content and interpret images based the provided schema.", "page_context": "One H4D team discovered a company during their interviews that developed a solution like the one they envisioned. The company had never considered the government as a customer. This team met with the company to tell them about the work they did in the class. The company was so impressed with the team\u2019s work that they hired a member of the H4D team to develop the team\u2019s Decision-Maker into a paying customer. The experience provided the student with valuable professional experience (and money!), the company with added revenue and a new customer, and the government with a valued solution.\n\n## Option #4: Create a company\n\nMany hackers and teams are inspired by the successes of H4D teams-turned-companies like Anthro Energy, Capella Space, Learn to Win, and Vannevar Labs, are passionate about continuing their project, and want to pursue the same pathway. These people are thoroughly able to answer the majority of questions in the checklist at the beginning of the chapter. More importantly, they recognize that having airtight answers, a good idea, excited Beneficiaries, and supportive Champions is an important foundation, but it isn\u2019t sufficient to build a viable business. For these people, and these people alone, forming a company is a good option.\n\nHaving a burning desire to continue learning and iterating on a solution in a chaotic environment is necessary for creating a company. H4D provided teams with the \u2018training wheels\u2019 necessary to learn the process. Hackers will now guide themselves through developing a viable business model to sustain a company. Much work lies ahead. Some examples include deeply understanding the government\u2019s acquisition process to make a sale. You\u2019ll need more information about gaining government funding (colors of money), various compliance requirements to advance your solution\u2019s readiness up the TRLs, and the contracting vehicles you will use to deliver your solution. Most teams will need to develop their solution. Before they do, they need to determine if spending the time and money to do so is worthwhile by conducting a cost-benefit analysis. For information on these topics, follow my Substack at [stanfordh4d.substack.com](http://stanfordh4d.substack.com).\n\nFor example, are there enough Beneficiaries to generate sufficient revenue to both cover your costs and produce profit? Addressing these topics requires you to do additional rounds of interviews. After class, Learn to Win labeled each of their milestone sprints \u201cH4D sprints\u201d and assigned a sequential number to each. The last I knew, the company was on H4D sprint #22. Learn to Win\u2019s example, and your experience in the class, should give you some insight into what pursuing this option looks like in practice. If this excites you, your team members are aligned with sharing this burden and a direction forward, and you have the resources to continue, then you are in for an enriching and wild ride.\n\nThe first opportunity most H4D teams-turned-companies pursue is the Small Business Innovation Research grant (SBIR, pronounced like Sib-er) and the Small Business Technology Transfer grant (STTR, pronounced Sit-er). For instance, Capella Space, FLIP.ai, Learn to Win, Vannevar Labs, and dozens more have all been recipients. SBIR funds research by small businesses and,", "page_summary": "This page discusses how H4D teams can transition their projects into companies, inspired by previous successful teams. It outlines the requirements and challenges of forming a company, such as understanding government acquisition, funding, compliance, and conducting cost-benefit analyses. The page also highlights the importance of passion, teamwork, and resources, and introduces SBIR and STTR grants as initial funding opportunities for new companies.", "images_interpretations": []}
{"page_number": 183, "screenshot_filename": "page_0183.png", "instructions_model_received": "Extract book content and interpret images based the provided schema.", "page_context": "At the time of writing, SBIR is supported by eleven federal agencies. STTR funds research by small businesses and non-profit U.S. research institutions, such as universities. At the time of writing, five federal agencies participate in STTR. The difference between the two is that SBIR funds small businesses only. STTR funds a team consisting of a small business and a research institution.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that SBIR/STTR grants are not contracts. They are grants. This means that companies effectively get funded to conduct Customer Discovery in the government to determine if they can develop a paying government customer. SBIR/STTR is a terrific opportunity to get paid to do what is effectively another round of H4D. The work you will do there is a continuation of the work you\u2019ve already done. Winning a SBIR/STTR award will require you to leverage your knowledge and network of people. For example, getting a letter of support from your Problem Sponsor, Decision-Maker, and/or Champion and including it in your proposal will put you ahead of other companies applying. Your application will invariably include some of the quotes, slides, MVPs, Influence Maps, and Workflow Diagrams you created in class. In fact, H4D teams are incredibly successful at winning SBIR/STTR grants because they often know the problem space better than other commercial companies applying.\n\nIf creating a company or winning a SBIR/STTR interests you, teams will need to do a series of steps to form a company. This is an important undertaking and there are several nuances to doing it based on your vision and the physical location of your company, and several other factors. Below is a partial list (in no particular order) of generic, and necessary, tasks that need to be executed. Note that it is partial and generic.\n\n1. Select a business name\n2. Choose a business structure\n3. Register your business in a state\n4. Obtain an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service\n5. Open a business bank account\n6. Register in SAM (www.sam.gov) to do business with the U.S. federal government\n7. Secure funding\n8. Create a logo, website, and messaging that reflects your business\n9. Establish a physical and/or virtual business\n10. Set up accounting and record-keeping\n\nHackers are encouraged to consult with organizations that specialize in the company formation process. H4XLabs is one organization that can support you. As their name indicates, they specialize in helping H4D teams transition into becoming companies. If you are interested in participating in the H4XLabs accelerator program, or require advice on the below, contact them at h4xlabs@bmnt.com.\n\nConclusion\n\nFinishing this class represents an important milestone. Very few people have a reserve of experiences like those you gained in H4D. Every hacker moves forward knowing they have meaningfully contributed to solving a real-life national security problem set. Spending a little time reflecting on your experience will ensure your work continues and that your hard-fought problem-solving skills and personal insights carry you forward beyond the classroom.

Finishing this book is yet another painful reminder of what an ass I was in my teens. Any attempt to write this book alone would have resulted in abject failure. The only reason it wasn\u2019t is because of the many, many people listed below. I owe a debt to them all.\n\nFirst and foremost, I\u2019d like to thank the Hacking for Defense co-founders Steve Blank, Joe Felter, and Pete Newell for creating this impactful class and for leading from the front. I\u2019ve had a front row seat to co-teaching with Steve, Joe, Pete, Steve Weinstein, Tom Byers, and Tom Bedecarre. Everything I learned about H4D and Lean Startup came from them. Thanks also to Alex Osterwalder who iterated with us to create the Beneficiary-Value Proposition Canvas.\n\nSupport for this book came from the Office of Naval Research. Maria Medeiros and Corey Love ensured that I had the resources necessary to make this book a reality. Moreover, they boldly gave me an opportunity to test some of the concepts used in this book which was invaluable to evolving the tasks presented at the end of each chapter.\n\nThe Stanford H4D class has been successful because of the support it has from amazing Teaching Assistants. Several of those Teaching Assistants provided valuable feedback on ideas and early drafts of this book. A special thanks goes to Joel Johnson, Nate Simon, Nick Mirda, Sam Lisbonne, Valeria Rincon, Malika Aubakirova, Nestor Walters, Andrew Radford, and Sam Jackson for letting me bend their ears and graciously fitting conversations with me into their schedule.\n\nOver the past two years, several H4D instructors and students provided valuable comments on the manuscript. The H4D instructors include Bull Holland, Jim Santa, Buddy Clark, Magdalini Lagoudas, Rich Lawson, Justin Finelli, Buddy Clark, Grant Fox, Justin Fanelli, Kevin Landtroop, Jeff Hui, Bernd Kaussler, Shye Gilad, and JD Englehart. J. David Riel was particularly generous with his schedule and his input. H4D students include Noah Sheinbaum, Sophie Fujiwara, Matthew Trost, Aramis Kellekyan, Andrew Powell, Payam Banazadeh, Logan Dopp, Noah Ringler, Jordi Villa, Jeff Jang, Jhon Ewunetie, Stefano Delmonte, Rachel Hirshman, Kyle Orciuch, and Josh Pickering. Remmelt Ammerlaan not only provided comments, but also suggested the Chat4D prompts you see at the end of each chapter. A particularly warm thank you goes out to Sophia Vahanvaty who worked with me weekly for two years providing her journalistic take and unvarnished feedback that made the book what it is. It wouldn\u2019t have been nearly as clear and comprehensive without her support.\n\nI also received significant editorial support for this manuscript. Stuart Murray helped whip rough drafts of this into shape. His red pen, though daunting, was critical to ensuring the ideas presented weren\u2019t mashed together and made sense to people other than myself.

History is replete with examples of small militaries defeating enemies fielding greater numbers. In 480 BCE at the Battle of Thermopylae, 7,000 Greeks (300 of whom were Spartan) withstood an onslaught of a Persian army numbering between 70,000 and 300,000. During the Hundred Years\u2019 War, 6,000 English longbow archers and dismounted knights vanquished 36,000 French knights, archers, and infantry. More recently, the Ukrainian military has been holding off Russian forces that have almost three times as many soldiers, nearly five times more armored vehicles, and twelve times the number of aircraft.\n\n4. This is a quote from a letter that Vannevar Bush wrote to President Herbert Hoover.

Buyers are the people responsible for purchasing the solution. While Buyers are a necessary component to delivering solutions, they rarely benefit from the solution. Buyers are addressed in Step 5: Buy-In & Support.\n\n7. The proverb is found in a number of forms, beginning as early as the 13th century.

The concept of Buy-In & Support is the government interpretation of \u201cCustomer Relationships\u201d in Alexander Osterwalder and Yves Pigneur, *Business Model Generation*.\n\n12. The Stanford fellows corroborated this lesson by mapping the Air Force and Navy innovation landscapes.

Some H4D students work on non-technical solutions such as organizational process changes or policy recommendations. While the TRL scale doesn\u2019t apply, considering the level of maturity your solution needs to be at to be considered by a government organization is as important for non-technical solutions as it is for technical solutions. Common Ground (the team from the Mission Achievement Chapter) is a good example.\n\n16.

In addition, L2W reviewed the Key Partnerships box of the MMC to identify potential partners that could potentially alleviate their costs. L2W recognized that H4XLabs might be a Key Partner that could help them offset costs. However, L2W was too early in the process to pursue the partnership.
